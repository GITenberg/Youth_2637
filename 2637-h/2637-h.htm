    <h2>
      I. WHAT I CONSIDER TO HAVE BEEN THE BEGINNING OF MY YOUTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have said that my friendship with Dimitri opened up for me a new view of
      my life and of its aim and relations. The essence of that view lay in the
      conviction that the destiny of man is to strive for moral improvement, and
      that such improvement is at once easy, possible, and lasting. Hitherto,
      however, I had found pleasure only in the new ideas which I discovered to
      arise from that conviction, and in the forming of brilliant plans for a
      moral, active future, while all the time my life had been continuing along
      its old petty, muddled, pleasure-seeking course, and the same virtuous
      thoughts which I and my adored friend Dimitri (&ldquo;my own marvellous Mitia,&rdquo;
       as I used to call him to myself in a whisper) had been wont to exchange
      with one another still pleased my intellect, but left my sensibility
      untouched. Nevertheless there came a moment when those thoughts swept into
      my head with a sudden freshness and force of moral revelation which left
      me aghast at the amount of time which I had been wasting, and made me feel
      as though I must at once&mdash;that very second&mdash;apply those thoughts
      to life, with the firm intention of never again changing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is from that moment that I date the beginning of my youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was then nearly sixteen. Tutors still attended to give me lessons, St.
      Jerome still acted as general supervisor of my education, and,
      willy-nilly, I was being prepared for the University. In addition to my
      studies, my occupations included certain vague dreamings and ponderings, a
      number of gymnastic exercises to make myself the finest athlete in the
      world, a good deal of aimless, thoughtless wandering through the rooms of
      the house (but more especially along the maidservants&rsquo; corridor), and much
      looking at myself in the mirror. From the latter, however, I always turned
      away with a vague feeling of depression, almost of repulsion. Not only did
      I feel sure that my exterior was ugly, but I could derive no comfort from
      any of the usual consolations under such circumstances. I could not say,
      for instance, that I had at least an expressive, clever, or refined face,
      for there was nothing whatever expressive about it. Its features were of
      the most humdrum, dull, and unbecoming type, with small grey eyes which
      seemed to me, whenever I regarded them in the mirror, to be stupid rather
      than clever. Of manly bearing I possessed even less, since, although I was
      not exactly small of stature, and had, moreover, plenty of strength for my
      years, every feature in my face was of the meek, sleepy-looking,
      indefinite type. Even refinement was lacking in it, since, on the
      contrary, it precisely resembled that of a simple-looking moujik, while I
      also had the same big hands and feet as he. At the time, all this seemed
      to me very shameful.

    <h2>
      II. SPRINGTIME
    </h2>
    <p>
      Easter of the year when I entered the University fell late in April, so
      that the examinations were fixed for St. Thomas&rsquo;s Week, [Easter week.] and
      I had to spend Good Friday in fasting and finally getting myself ready for
      the ordeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following upon wet snow (the kind of stuff which Karl Ivanitch used to
      describe as &ldquo;a child following, its father&rdquo;), the weather had for three
      days been bright and mild and still. Not a clot of snow was now to be seen
      in the streets, and the dirty slush had given place to wet, shining
      pavements and coursing rivulets. The last icicles on the roofs were fast
      melting in the sunshine, buds were swelling on the trees in the little
      garden, the path leading across the courtyard to the stables was soft
      instead of being a frozen ridge of mud, and mossy grass was showing green
      between the stones around the entrance-steps. It was just that particular
      time in spring when the season exercises the strongest influence upon the
      human soul&mdash;when clear sunlight illuminates everything, yet sheds no
      warmth, when rivulets run trickling under one&rsquo;s feet, when the air is
      charged with an odorous freshness, and when the bright blue sky is
      streaked with long, transparent clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason or another the influence of this early stage in the birth
      of spring always seems to me more perceptible and more impressive in a
      great town than in the country. One sees less, but one feels more. I was
      standing near the window&mdash;through the double frames of which the
      morning sun was throwing its mote-flecked beams upon the floor of what
      seemed to me my intolerably wearisome schoolroom&mdash;and working out a
      long algebraical equation on the blackboard. In one hand I was holding a
      ragged, long-suffering &ldquo;Algebra&rdquo; and in the other a small piece of chalk
      which had already besmeared my hands, my face, and the elbows of my
      jacket. Nicola, clad in an apron, and with his sleeves rolled up, was
      picking out the putty from the window-frames with a pair of nippers, and
      unfastening the screws. The window looked out upon the little garden. At
      length his occupation and the noise which he was making over it arrested
      my attention. At the moment I was in a very cross, dissatisfied frame of
      mind, for nothing seemed to be going right with me. I had made a mistake
      at the very beginning of my algebra, and so should have to work it out
      again; twice I had let the chalk drop. I was conscious that my hands and
      face were whitened all over; the sponge had rolled away into a corner; and
      the noise of Nicola&rsquo;s operations was fast getting on my nerves. I had a
      feeling as though I wanted to fly into a temper and grumble at some one,
      so I threw down chalk and &ldquo;Algebra&rdquo; alike, and began to pace the room.
      Then suddenly I remembered that to-day we were to go to confession, and
      that therefore I must refrain from doing anything wrong. Next, with equal
      suddenness I relapsed into an extraordinarily goodhumoured frame of mind,
      and walked across to Nicola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me help you, Nicola,&rdquo; I said, trying to speak as pleasantly as I
      possibly could. The idea that I was performing a meritorious action in
      thus suppressing my ill-temper and offering to help him increased my
      good-humour all the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the putty had been chipped out, and the screws removed, yet,
      though Nicola pulled with might and main at the cross-piece, the
      window-frame refused to budge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it comes out as soon as he and I begin to pull at it together,&rdquo; I
      thought, &ldquo;it will be rather a shame, as then I shall have nothing more of
      the kind to do to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the frame yielded a little at one side, and came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I put it?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let ME see to it, if you please,&rdquo; replied Nicola, evidently surprised as
      well as, seemingly, not over-pleased at my zeal. &ldquo;We must not leave it
      here, but carry it away to the lumber-room, where I keep all the frames
      stored and numbered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I can manage it,&rdquo; I said as I lifted it up. I verily believe that
      if the lumber-room had been a couple of versts away, and the frame twice
      as heavy as it was, I should have been the more pleased. I felt as though
      I wanted to tire myself out in performing this service for Nicola. When I
      returned to the room the bricks and screws had been replaced on the
      windowsill, and Nicola was sweeping the debris, as well as a few torpid
      flies, out of the open window. The fresh, fragrant air was rushing into
      and filling all the room, while with it came also the dull murmur of the
      city and the twittering of sparrows in the garden. Everything was in
      brilliant light, the room looked cheerful, and a gentle spring breeze was
      stirring Nicola&rsquo;s hair and the leaves of my &ldquo;Algebra.&rdquo; Approaching the
      window, I sat down upon the sill, turned my eyes downwards towards the
      garden, and fell into a brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something new to me, something extraordinarily potent and unfamiliar, had
      suddenly invaded my soul. The wet ground on which, here and there, a few
      yellowish stalks and blades of bright-green grass were to be seen; the
      little rivulets glittering in the sunshine, and sweeping clods of earth
      and tiny chips of wood along with them; the reddish twigs of the lilac,
      with their swelling buds, which nodded just beneath the window; the fussy
      twitterings of birds as they fluttered in the bush below; the blackened
      fence shining wet from the snow which had lately melted off it; and, most
      of all, the raw, odorous air and radiant sunlight&mdash;all spoke to me,
      clearly and unmistakably, of something new and beautiful, of something
      which, though I cannot repeat it here as it was then expressed to me, I
      will try to reproduce so far as I understood it. Everything spoke to me of
      beauty, happiness, and virtue&mdash;as three things which were both easy
      and possible for me&mdash;and said that no one of them could exist without
      the other two, since beauty, happiness, and virtue were one. &ldquo;How did I
      never come to understand that before?&rdquo; I cried to myself. &ldquo;How did I ever
      manage to be so wicked? Oh, but how good, how happy, I could be&mdash;nay,
      I WILL be&mdash;in the future! At once, at once&mdash;yes, this very
      minute&mdash;I will become another being, and begin to live differently!&rdquo;
       For all that, I continued sitting on the window-sill, continued merely
      dreaming, and doing nothing. Have you ever, on a summer&rsquo;s day, gone to bed
      in dull, rainy weather, and, waking just at sunset, opened your eyes and
      seen through the square space of the window&mdash;the space where the
      linen blind is blowing up and down, and beating its rod upon the
      window-sill&mdash;the rain-soaked, shadowy, purple vista of an avenue of
      lime-trees, with a damp garden path lit up by the clear, slanting beams of
      the sun, and then suddenly heard the joyous sounds of bird life in the
      garden, and seen insects flying to and fro at the open window, and
      glittering in the sunlight, and smelt the fragrance of the rain-washed
      air, and thought to yourself, &ldquo;Am I not ashamed to be lying in bed on such
      an evening as this?&rdquo; and, leaping joyously to your feet, gone out into the
      garden and revelled in all that welter of life? If you have, then you can
      imagine for yourself the overpowering sensation which was then possessing
      me.

      III. DREAMS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day I will make my confession and purge myself of every sin,&rdquo; I
      thought to myself. &ldquo;Nor will I ever commit another one.&rdquo; At this point I
      recalled all the peccadilloes which most troubled my conscience. &ldquo;I will
      go to church regularly every Sunday, as well as read the Gospel at the
      close of every hour throughout the day. What is more, I will set aside,
      out of the cheque which I shall receive each month after I have gone to
      the University, two-and-a-half roubles&rdquo; (a tenth of my monthly allowance)
      &ldquo;for people who are poor but not exactly beggars, yet without letting any
      one know anything about it. Yes, I will begin to look out for people like
      that&mdash;orphans or old women&mdash;at once, yet never tell a soul what
      I am doing for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also, I will have a room here of my very own (St. Jerome&rsquo;s, probably),
      and look after it myself, and keep it perfectly clean. I will never let
      any one do anything for me, for every one is just a human being like
      myself. Likewise I will walk every day, not drive, to the University. Even
      if some one gives me a drozhki [Russian phaeton.] I will sell it, and
      devote the money to the poor. Everything I will do exactly and always&rdquo;
       (what that &ldquo;always&rdquo; meant I could not possibly have said, but at least I
      had a vivid consciousness of its connoting some kind of prudent, moral,
      and irreproachable life). &ldquo;I will get up all my lectures thoroughly, and
      go over all the subjects beforehand, so that at the end of my first course
      I may come out top and write a thesis. During my second course also I will
      get up everything beforehand, so that I may soon be transferred to the
      third course, and at eighteen come out top in the examinations, and
      receive two gold medals, and go on to be Master of Arts, and Doctor, and
      the first scholar in Europe. Yes, in all Europe I mean to be the first
      scholar.&mdash;Well, what next?&rdquo; I asked myself at this point. Suddenly it
      struck me that dreams of this sort were a form of pride&mdash;a sin which
      I should have to confess to the priest that very evening, so I returned to
      the original thread of my meditations. &ldquo;When getting up my lectures I will
      go to the Vorobievi Gori, [Sparrow Hills&mdash;a public park near Moscow.]
      and choose some spot under a tree, and read my lectures over there.
      Sometimes I will take with me something to eat&mdash;cheese or a pie from
      Pedotti&rsquo;s, or something of the kind. After that I will sleep a little, and
      then read some good book or other, or else draw pictures or play on some
      instrument (certainly I must learn to play the flute). Perhaps SHE too
      will be walking on the Vorobievi Gori, and will approach me one day and
      say, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; and I shall look at her, oh, so sadly, and say that I
      am the son of a priest, and that I am happy only when I am there alone,
      quite alone. Then she will give me her hand, and say something to me, and
      sit down beside me. So every day we shall go to the same spot, and be
      friends together, and I shall kiss her. But no! That would not be right!
      On the contrary, from this day forward I never mean to look at a woman
      again. Never, never again do I mean to walk with a girl, nor even to go
      near one if I can help it. Yet, of course, in three years&rsquo; time, when I
      have come of age, I shall marry. Also, I mean to take as much exercise as
      ever I can, and to do gymnastics every day, so that, when I have turned
      twenty-five, I shall be stronger even than Rappo. On my first day&rsquo;s
      training I mean to hold out half a pood [The Pood = 40 Russian pounds.] at
      arm&rsquo;s length for five minutes, and the next day twenty-one pounds, and the
      third day twenty-two pounds, and so on, until at last I can hold out four
      poods in each hand, and be stronger even than a porter. Then, if ever any
      one should try to insult me or should begin to speak disrespectfully of
      HER, I shall take him so, by the front of his coat, and lift him up an
      arshin [The arshin = 2 feet 3 inches.] or two with one hand, and just hold
      him there, so that he may feel my strength and cease from his conduct. Yet
      that too would not be right. No, no, it would not matter; I should not
      hurt him, merely show him that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let no one blame me because the dreams of my youth were as foolish as
      those of my childhood and boyhood. I am sure that, even if it be my fate
      to live to extreme old age and to continue my story with the years, I, an
      old man of seventy, shall be found dreaming dreams just as impossible and
      childish as those I am dreaming now. I shall be dreaming of some lovely
      Maria who loves me, the toothless old man, as she might love a Mazeppa; of
      some imbecile son who, through some extraordinary chance, has suddenly
      become a minister of state; of my suddenly receiving a windfall of a
      million of roubles. I am sure that there exists no human being, no human
      age, to whom or to which that gracious, consolatory power of dreaming is
      totally a stranger. Yet, save for the one general feature of magic and
      impossibility, the dreams of each human being, of each age of man, have
      their own distinguishing characteristics. At the period upon which I look
      as having marked the close of my boyhood and the beginning of my youth,
      four leading sentiments formed the basis of my dreams. The first of those
      sentiments was love for HER&mdash;for an imaginary woman whom I always
      pictured the same in my dreams, and whom I somehow expected to meet some
      day and somewhere. This she of mine had a little of Sonetchka in her, a
      little of Masha as Masha could look when she stood washing linen over the
      clothes-tub, and a little of a certain woman with pearls round her fair
      white neck whom I had once seen long, long ago at a theatre, in a box
      below our own. My second sentiment was a craving for love. I wanted every
      one to know me and to love me. I wanted to be able to utter my name&mdash;Nicola
      Irtenieff&mdash;and at once to see every one thunderstruck at it, and come
      crowding round me and thanking me for something or another, I hardly knew
      what. My third sentiment was the expectation of some extraordinary,
      glorious happiness that was impending&mdash;some happiness so strong and
      assured as to verge upon ecstasy. Indeed, so firmly persuaded was I that
      very, very soon some unexpected chance would suddenly make me the richest
      and most famous man in the world that I lived in constant, tremulous
      expectation of this magic good fortune befalling me. I was always thinking
      to myself that &ldquo;IT is beginning,&rdquo; and that I should go on thereafter to
      attain everything that a man could wish for. Consequently, I was for ever
      hurrying from place to place, in the belief that &ldquo;IT&rdquo; must be &ldquo;beginning&rdquo;
       just where I happened not to be. Lastly, my fourth and principal sentiment
      of all was abhorrence of myself, mingled with regret&mdash;yet a regret so
      blended with the certain expectation of happiness to which I have referred
      that it had in it nothing of sorrow. It seemed to me that it would be so
      easy and natural for me to tear myself away from my past and to remake it&mdash;to
      forget all that had been, and to begin my life, with all its relations,
      anew&mdash;that the past never troubled me, never clung to me at all. I
      even found a certain pleasure in detesting the past, and in seeing it in a
      darker light than the true one. This note of regret and of a curious
      longing for perfection were the chief mental impressions which I gathered
      from that new stage of my growth&mdash;impressions which imparted new
      principles to my view of myself, of men, and of God&rsquo;s world. O good and
      consoling voice, which in later days, in sorrowful days when my soul
      yielded silently to the sway of life&rsquo;s falseness and depravity, so often
      raised a sudden, bold protest against all iniquity, as well as mercilessly
      exposed the past, commanded, nay, compelled, me to love only the pure
      vista of the present, and promised me all that was fair and happy in the
      future! O good and consoling voice! Surely the day will never come when
      you are silent?

    <h2>
      IV. OUR FAMILY CIRCLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      PAPA was seldom at home that spring. Yet, whenever he was so, he seemed
      extraordinarily cheerful as he either strummed his favourite pieces on the
      piano or looked roguishly at us and made jokes about us all, not excluding
      even Mimi. For instance, he would say that the Tsarevitch himself had seen
      Mimi at the rink, and fallen so much in love with her that he had
      presented a petition to the Synod for divorce; or else that I had been
      granted an appointment as secretary to the Austrian ambassador&mdash;a
      piece of news which he imparted to us with a perfectly grave face. Next,
      he would frighten Katenka with some spiders (of which she was very much
      afraid), engage in an animated conversation with our friends Dubkoff and
      Nechludoff, and tell us and our guests, over and over again, his plans for
      the year. Although these plans changed almost from day to day, and were
      for ever contradicting one another, they seemed so attractive that we were
      always glad to listen to them, and Lubotshka, in particular, would glue
      her eyes to his face, so as not to lose a single word. One day his plan
      would be that he should leave my brother and myself at the University, and
      go and live with Lubotshka in Italy for two years. Next, the plan would be
      that he should buy an estate on the south coast of the Crimea, and take us
      for an annual visit there; next, that we should migrate en masse to St.
      Petersburg; and so forth. Yet, in addition to this unusual cheerfulness of
      his, another change had come over him of late&mdash;a change which greatly
      surprised me. This was that he had had some fashionable clothes made&mdash;an
      olive-coloured frockcoat, smart trousers with straps at the sides, and a
      long wadded greatcoat which fitted him to perfection. Often, too, there
      was a delightful smell of scent about him when he came home from a party&mdash;more
      especially when he had been to see a lady of whom Mimi never spoke but
      with a sigh and a face that seemed to say: &ldquo;Poor orphans! How dreadful! It
      is a good thing that SHE is gone now!&rdquo; and so on, and so on. From Nicola
      (for Papa never spoke to us of his gambling) I had learnt that he (Papa)
      had been very fortunate in play that winter, and so had won an
      extraordinary amount of money, all of which he had placed in the bank
      after vowing that he would play no more that spring. Evidently, it was his
      fear of being unable to resist again doing so that was rendering him
      anxious to leave for the country as soon as possible. Indeed, he ended by
      deciding not to wait until I had entered the University, but to take the
      girls to Petrovskoe immediately after Easter, and to leave Woloda and
      myself to follow them at a later season.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that winter, until the opening of spring, Woloda had been inseparable
      from Dubkoff, while at the same time the pair of them had cooled greatly
      towards Dimitri. Their chief amusements (so I gathered from conversations
      overheard) were continual drinking of champagne, sledge-driving past the
      windows of a lady with whom both of them appeared to be in love, and
      dancing with her&mdash;not at children&rsquo;s parties, either, but at real
      balls! It was this last fact which, despite our love for one another,
      placed a vast gulf between Woloda and myself. We felt that the distance
      between a boy still taking lessons under a tutor and a man who danced at
      real, grown-up balls was too great to allow of their exchanging mutual
      ideas. Katenka, too, seemed grown-up now, and read innumerable novels; so
      that the idea that she would some day be getting married no longer seemed
      to me a joke. Yet, though she and Woloda were thus grown-up, they never
      made friends with one another, but, on the contrary, seemed to cherish a
      mutual contempt. In general, when Katenka was at home alone, nothing but
      novels amused her, and they but slightly; but as soon as ever a visitor of
      the opposite sex called, she at once grew lively and amiable, and used her
      eyes for saying things which I could not then understand. It was only
      later, when she one day informed me in conversation that the only thing a
      girl was allowed to indulge in was coquetry&mdash;coquetry of the eyes, I
      mean&mdash;that I understood those strange contortions of her features
      which to every one else had seemed a matter for no surprise at all.
      Lubotshka also had begun to wear what was almost a long dress&mdash;a
      dress which almost concealed her goose-shaped feet; yet she still remained
      as ready a weeper as ever. She dreamed now of marrying, not a hussar, but
      a singer or an instrumentalist, and accordingly applied herself to her
      music with greater diligence than ever. St. Jerome, who knew that he was
      going to remain with us only until my examinations were over, and so had
      obtained for himself a new post in the family of some count or another,
      now looked with contempt upon the members of our household. He stayed
      indoors very little, took to smoking cigarettes (then all the rage), and
      was for ever whistling lively tunes on the edge of a card. Mimi daily grew
      more and more despondent, as though, now that we were beginning to grow
      up, she looked for nothing good from any one or anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, on the day of which I am speaking, I went in to luncheon I found
      only Mimi, Katenka, Lubotshka, and St. Jerome in the dining-room. Papa was
      away, and Woloda in his own room, doing some preparation work for his
      examinations in company with a party of his comrades: wherefore he had
      requested that lunch should be sent to him there. Of late, Mimi had
      usually taken the head of the table, and as none of us had any respect for
      her, luncheon had lost most of its refinement and charm. That is to say,
      the meal was no longer what it had been in Mamma&rsquo;s or our grandmother&rsquo;s
      time, namely, a kind of rite which brought all the family together at a
      given hour and divided the day into two halves. We allowed ourselves to
      come in as late as the second course, to drink wine in tumblers (St.
      Jerome himself set us the example), to roll about on our chairs, to depart
      without saying grace, and so on. In fact, luncheon had ceased to be a
      family ceremony. In the old days at Petrovskoe, every one had been used to
      wash and dress for the meal, and then to repair to the drawing-room as the
      appointed hour (two o&rsquo;clock) drew near, and pass the time of waiting in
      lively conversation. Just as the clock in the servants&rsquo; hall was beginning
      to whirr before striking the hour, Foka would enter with noiseless
      footsteps, and, throwing his napkin over his arm and assuming a dignified,
      rather severe expression, would say in loud, measured tones: &ldquo;Luncheon is
      ready!&rdquo; Thereupon, with pleased, cheerful faces, we would form a
      procession&mdash;the elders going first and the juniors following, and,
      with much rustling of starched petticoats and subdued creaking of boots
      and shoes&mdash;would proceed to the dining-room, where, still talking in
      undertones, the company would seat themselves in their accustomed places.
      Or, again, at Moscow, we would all of us be standing before the table
      ready-laid in the hall, talking quietly among ourselves as we waited for
      our grandmother, whom the butler, Gabriel, had gone to acquaint with the
      fact that luncheon was ready. Suddenly the door would open, there would
      come the faint swish of a dress and the sound of footsteps, and our
      grandmother&mdash;dressed in a mob-cap trimmed with a quaint old lilac
      bow, and wearing either a smile or a severe expression on her face
      according as the state of her health inclined her&mdash;would issue from
      her room. Gabriel would hasten to precede her to her arm-chair, the other
      chairs would make a scraping sound, and, with a feeling as though a cold
      shiver (the precursor of appetite) were running down one&rsquo;s back, one would
      seize upon one&rsquo;s damp, starched napkin, nibble a morsel or two of bread,
      and, rubbing one&rsquo;s hands softly under the table, gaze with eager, radiant
      impatience at the steaming plates of soup which the butler was beginning
      to dispense in order of ranks and ages or according to the favour of our
      grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the present occasion, however, I was conscious of neither excitement
      nor pleasure when I went in to luncheon. Even the mingled chatter of Mimi,
      the girls, and St. Jerome about the horrible boots of our Russian tutor,
      the pleated dresses worn by the young Princesses Kornakoff, and so forth
      (chatter which at any other time would have filled me with a sincerity of
      contempt which I should have been at no pains to conceal&mdash;at all
      events so far as Lubotshka and Katenka were concerned), failed to shake
      the benevolent frame of mind into which I had fallen. I was unusually
      good-humoured that day, and listened to everything with a smile and a
      studied air of kindness. Even when I asked for the kvas I did so politely,
      while I lost not a moment in agreeing with St. Jerome when he told me that
      it was undoubtedly more correct to say &ldquo;Je peux&rdquo; than &ldquo;Je puis.&rdquo; Yet, I
      must confess to a certain disappointment at finding that no one paid any
      particular attention to my politeness and good-humour. After luncheon,
      Lubotshka showed me a paper on which she had written down a list of her
      sins: upon which I observed that, although the idea was excellent so far
      as it went, it would be still better for her to write down her sins on her
      SOUL&mdash;&ldquo;a very different matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it &lsquo;a very different matter&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Lubotshka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind: that is all right; you do not understand me,&rdquo; and I went
      upstairs to my room, telling St. Jerome that I was going to work, but in
      reality purposing to occupy the hour and a half before confession time in
      writing down a list of my daily tasks and duties which should last me all
      my life, together with a statement of my life&rsquo;s aim, and the rules by
      which I meant unswervingly to be guided.

    <h2>
      V. MY RULES
    </h2>
    <p>
      I TOOK some sheets of paper, and tried, first of all, to make a list of my
      tasks and duties for the coming year. The paper needed ruling, but, as I
      could not find the ruler, I had to use a Latin dictionary instead. The
      result was that, when I had drawn the pen along the edge of the dictionary
      and removed the latter, I found that, in place of a line, I had only made
      an oblong smudge on the paper, since the dictionary was not long enough to
      reach across it, and the pen had slipped round the soft, yielding corner
      of the book. Thereupon I took another piece of paper, and, by carefully
      manipulating the dictionary, contrived to rule what at least RESEMBLED
      lines. Dividing my duties into three sections&mdash;my duties to myself,
      my duties to my neighbour, and my duties to God&mdash;I started to indite
      a list of the first of those sections, but they seemed to me so numerous,
      and therefore requiring to be divided into so many species and
      subdivisions, that I thought I had better first of all write down the
      heading of &ldquo;Rules of My Life&rdquo; before proceeding to their detailed
      inscription. Accordingly, I proceeded to write &ldquo;Rules of My Life&rdquo; on the
      outside of the six sheets of paper which I had made into a sort of folio,
      but the words came out in such a crooked and uneven scrawl that for long I
      sat debating the question, &ldquo;Shall I write them again?&rdquo;&mdash;for long, sat
      in agonised contemplation of the ragged handwriting and disfigured
      title-page. Why was it that all the beauty and clarity which my soul then
      contained came out so misshapenly on paper (as in life itself) just when I
      was wishing to apply those qualities to what I was thinking at the moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priest is here, so please come downstairs and hear his directions,&rdquo;
       said Nicola as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurriedly concealing my folio under the table-cloth, I looked at myself in
      the mirror, combed my hair upwards (I imagined this to give me a pensive
      air), and descended to the divannaia, [Room with divans, or ante-room]
      where the table stood covered with a cloth and had an ikon and candles
      placed upon it. Papa entered just as I did, but by another door: whereupon
      the priest&mdash;a grey-headed old monk with a severe, elderly face&mdash;blessed
      him, and Papa kissed his small, squat, wizened hand. I did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and call Woldemar,&rdquo; said Papa. &ldquo;Where is he? Wait a minute, though.
      Perhaps he is preparing for the Communion at the University?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is with the Prince,&rdquo; said Katenka, and glanced at Lubotshka.
      Suddenly the latter blushed for some reason or another, and then frowned.
      Finally, pretending that she was not well, she left the room, and I
      followed her. In the drawing-room she halted, and began to pencil
      something fresh on her paper of peccadilloes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what new sin have you gone and committed?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she replied with another blush. All at once we heard Dimitri&rsquo;s
      voice raised in the hall as he took his leave of Woloda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me you are always experiencing some new temptation,&rdquo; said
      Katenka, who had entered the room behind us, and now stood looking at
      Lubotshka.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the matter with my sister I could not conceive, but she was now
      so agitated that the tears were starting from her eyes. Finally her
      confusion grew uncontrollable, and vented itself in rage against both
      herself and Katenka, who appeared to be teasing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one can see that you are a FOREIGNER!&rdquo; she cried (nothing offended
      Katenka so much as to be called by that term, which is why Lubotshka used
      it). &ldquo;Just because I have the secret of which you know,&rdquo; she went on, with
      anger ringing through her tone, &ldquo;you purposely go and upset me! Please do
      understand that it is no joking matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what she has gone and written on her paper, Nicolinka?&rdquo; cried
      Katenka, much infuriated by the term &ldquo;foreigner.&rdquo; &ldquo;She has written down
      that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I never could have believed that you could be so cruel!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Lubotshka, now bursting into open sobbing as she moved away from us. &ldquo;You
      chose that moment on purpose! You spend your whole time in trying to make
      me sin! I&rsquo;ll never go to YOU again for sympathy and advice!&rdquo;

      VI. CONFESSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      With these and other disjointed impressions in my mind, I returned to the
      divannaia. As soon as every one had reassembled, the priest rose and
      prepared to read the prayer before confession. The instant that the
      silence was broken by the stern, expressive voice of the monk as he
      recited the prayer&mdash;and more especially when he addressed to us the
      words: &ldquo;Reveal thou all thy sins without shame, concealment, or
      extenuation, and let thy soul be cleansed before God: for if thou
      concealest aught, then great will be thy sin&rdquo;&mdash;the same sensation of
      reverent awe came over me as I had felt during the morning. I even took a
      certain pleasure in recognising this condition of mine, and strove to
      preserve it, not only by restraining all other thoughts from entering my
      brain, but also by consciously exerting myself to feel no other sensation
      than this same one of reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa was the first to go to confession. He remained a long, long time in
      the room which had belonged to our grandmother, and during that time the
      rest of us kept silence in the divannaia, or only whispered to one another
      on the subject of who should precede whom. At length, the voice of the
      priest again reading the prayer sounded from the doorway, and then Papa&rsquo;s
      footsteps. The door creaked as he came out, coughing and holding one
      shoulder higher than the other, in his usual way, and for the moment he
      did not look at any of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU go now, Luba,&rdquo; he said presently, as he gave her cheek a mischievous
      pinch. &ldquo;Mind you tell him everything. You are my greatest sinner, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubotshka went red and pale by turns, took her memorandum paper out of her
      apron, replaced it, and finally moved away towards the doorway with her
      head sunk between her shoulders as though she expected to receive a blow
      upon it from above. She was not long gone, and when she returned her
      shoulders were shaking with sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length&mdash;next after the excellent Katenka (who came out of the
      doorway with a smile on her face)&mdash;my turn arrived. I entered the
      dimly-lighted room with the same vague feeling of awe, the same conscious
      eagerness to arouse that feeling more and more in my soul, that had
      possessed me up to the present moment. The priest, standing in front of a
      reading-desk, slowly turned his face to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not more than five minutes in the room, but came out from it happy
      and (so I persuaded myself) entirely cleansed&mdash;a new, a morally
      reborn individual. Despite the fact that the old surroundings of my life
      now struck me as unfamiliar (even though the rooms, the furniture, and my
      own figure&mdash;would to heavens that I could have changed my outer man
      for the better in the same way that I believed myself to have changed my
      inner I&mdash;were the same as before), I remained in that comfortable
      attitude of mine until the very moment of bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, no sooner had I begun to grow drowsy with the conning over of my sins
      than in a flash I recollected a particularly shameful sin which I had
      suppressed at confession time. Instantly the words of the prayer before
      confession came back to my memory and began sounding in my ears. My peace
      was gone for ever. &ldquo;For if thou concealest aught, then great will be thy
      sin.&rdquo; Each time that the phrase recurred to me I saw myself a sinner for
      whom no punishment was adequate. Long did I toss from side to side as I
      considered my position, while expecting every moment to be visited with
      the divine wrath&mdash;to be struck with sudden death, perhaps!&mdash;an
      insupportable thought! Then suddenly the reassuring thought occurred to
      me: &ldquo;Why should I not drive out to the monastery when the morning comes,
      and see the priest again, and make a second confession?&rdquo; Thereafter I grew
      calmer.

    <h2>
      VII. THE EXPEDITION TO THE MONASTERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Several times that night I woke in terror at the thought that I might be
      oversleeping myself, and by six o&rsquo;clock was out of bed, although the dawn
      was hardly peeping in at the window. I put on my clothes and boots (all of
      which were lying tumbled and unbrushed beside the bed, since Nicola, of
      course had not been in yet to tidy them up), and, without a prayer said or
      my face washed, emerged, for the first time in my life, into the street
      ALONE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the way, behind the green roof of a large building, the dim, cold
      dawn was beginning to blush red. The keen frost of the spring morning
      which had stiffened the pools and mud and made them crackle under my feet
      now nipped my face and hands also. Not a cab was to be seen, though I had
      counted upon one to make the journey out and home the quicker. Only a file
      of waggons was rumbling along the Arbat Prospect, and a couple of
      bricklayers talking noisily together as they strode along the pavement.
      However, after walking a verst or so I began to meet men and women taking
      baskets to market or going with empty barrels to fetch the day&rsquo;s water
      supply; until at length, at the cross streets near the Arbat Gate, where a
      pieman had set up his stall and a baker was just opening his shop, I
      espied an old cabman shaking himself after indulging in a nap on the box
      of his be-scratched old blue-painted, hobble-de-hoy wreck of a drozhki. He
      seemed barely awake as he asked twenty copecks as the fare to the
      monastery and back, but came to himself a moment afterwards, just as I was
      about to get in, and, touching up his horse with the spare end of the
      reins, started to drive off and leave me. &ldquo;My horse wants feeding,&rdquo; he
      growled, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take you, barin.[Sir]&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With some difficulty and a promise of FORTY copecks I persuaded him to
      stop. He eyed me narrowly as he pulled up, but nevertheless said: &ldquo;Very
      well. Get in, barin.&rdquo; I must confess that I had some qualms lest he should
      drive me to a quiet corner somewhere, and then rob me, but I caught hold
      of the collar of his ragged driving-coat, close to where his wrinkled neck
      showed sadly lean above his hunched-up back, and climbed on to the
      blue-painted, curved, rickety scat. As we set off along Vozdvizhenka
      Street, I noticed that the back of the drozhki was covered with a strip of
      the same greenish material as that of which his coat was made. For some
      reason or another this reassured me, and I no longer felt nervous of being
      taken to a quiet spot and robbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had risen to a good height, and was gilding the cupolas of the
      churches, when we arrived at the monastery. In the shade the frost had not
      yet given, but in the open roadway muddy rivulets of water were coursing
      along, and it was through fast-thawing mire that the horse went
      clip-clopping his way. Alighting, and entering the monastery grounds, I
      inquired of the first monk whom I met where I could find the priest whom I
      was seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His cell is over there,&rdquo; replied the monk as he stopped a moment and
      pointed towards a little building up to which a flight of steps led.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I respectfully thank you,&rdquo; I said, and then fell to wondering what all
      the monks (who at that moment began to come filing out of the church) must
      be thinking of me as they glanced in my direction. I was neither a
      grown-up nor a child, while my face was unwashed, my hair unbrushed, my
      clothes tumbled, and my boots unblacked and muddy. To what class of
      persons were the brethren assigning me&mdash;for they stared at me hard
      enough? Nevertheless I proceeded in the direction which the young priest
      had pointed out to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man with bushy grey eyebrows and a black cassock met me on the
      narrow path to the cells, and asked me what I wanted. For a brief moment I
      felt inclined to say &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; and then run back to the drozhki and drive
      away home; but, for all its beetling brows, the face of the old man
      inspired confidence, and I merely said that I wished to see the priest
      (whom I named).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, young sir; I will take you to him,&rdquo; said the old man as he
      turned round. Clearly he had guessed my errand at a stroke. &ldquo;The father is
      at matins at this moment, but he will soon be back,&rdquo; and, opening a door,
      the old man led me through a neat hall and corridor, all lined with clean
      matting, to a cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to wait here,&rdquo; he added, and then, with a kind, reassuring glance,
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little room in which I found myself was of the smallest possible
      dimensions, but extremely neat and clean. Its furniture only consisted of
      a small table (covered with a cloth, and placed between two equally small
      casement-windows, in which stood two pots of geraniums), a stand of ikons,
      with a lamp suspended in front of them, a bench, and two chairs. In one
      corner hung a wall clock, with little flowers painted on its dial, and
      brass weights to its chains, while upon two nails driven into a screen
      (which, fastened to the ceiling with whitewashed pegs, probably concealed
      the bed) hung a couple of cassocks. The windows looked out upon a
      whitewashed wall, about two arshins distant, and in the space between them
      there grew a small lilac-bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a sound penetrated from without, and in the stillness the measured,
      friendly stroke of the clock&rsquo;s pendulum seemed to beat quite loudly. The
      instant that I found myself alone in this calm retreat all other thoughts
      and recollections left my head as completely as though they had never been
      there, and I subsided into an inexpressibly pleasing kind of torpor. The
      rusty alpaca cassocks with their frayed linings, the worn black leather
      bindings of the books with their metal clasps, the dull-green plants with
      their carefully watered leaves and soil, and, above all, the abrupt,
      regular beat of the pendulum, all spoke to me intimately of some new life
      hitherto unknown to me&mdash;a life of unity and prayer, of calm, restful
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The months, the years, may pass,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;but he remains
      alone&mdash;always at peace, always knowing that his conscience is pure
      before God, that his prayer will be heard by Him.&rdquo; For fully half an hour
      I sat on that chair, trying not to move, not even to breathe loudly, for
      fear I should mar the harmony of the sounds which were telling me so much,
      and ever the pendulum continued to beat the same&mdash;now a little louder
      to the right, now a little softer to the left.

    <h2>
      VIII. THE SECOND CONFESSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Suddenly the sound of the priest&rsquo;s footsteps roused me from this reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning to you,&rdquo; he said as he smoothed his grey hair with his hand.
      &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I besought him to give me his blessing, and then kissed his small, wizened
      hand with great fervour. After I had explained to him my errand he said
      nothing, but moved away towards the ikons, and began to read the
      exhortation: whereupon I overcame my shame, and told him all that was in
      my heart. Finally he laid his hands upon my head, and pronounced in his
      even, resonant voice the words: &ldquo;My son, may the blessing of Our Heavenly
      Father be upon thee, and may He always preserve thee in faithfulness,
      loving-kindness, and meekness. Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was entirely happy. Tears of joy coursed down my face as I kissed the
      hem of his cassock and then raised my head again. The face of the priest
      expressed perfect tranquillity. So keenly did I feel the joy of
      reconciliation that, fearing in any way to dispel it, I took hasty leave
      of him, and, without looking to one side of me or the other (in order that
      my attention might not be distracted), left the grounds and re-entered the
      rickety, battered drozhki. Yet the joltings of the vehicle and the variety
      of objects which flitted past my eyes soon dissipated that feeling, and I
      became filled with nothing but the idea that the priest must have thought
      me the finest-spirited young man he had ever met, or ever would meet, in
      the whole of his life. Indeed, I reflected, there could not be many such
      as myself&mdash;of that I felt sure, and the conviction produced in me the
      kind of complacency which craves for self-communication to another. I had
      a great desire to unbosom myself to some one, and as there was no one else
      to speak to, I addressed myself to the cabman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I very long gone?&rdquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not very long,&rdquo; he replied. He seemed to have grown more cheerful
      under the influence of the sunshine. &ldquo;Yet now it is a good while past my
      horse&rsquo;s feeding-time. You see, I am a night cabman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I only seemed to myself to be about a minute,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;Do you
      know what I went there for?&rdquo; I added, changing my seat to the well of the
      drozhki, so as to be nearer the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business is it of mine? I drive a fare where he tells me to go,&rdquo; he
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but, all the same, what do you think I went there for?&rdquo; I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect some one you know is going to be buried there, so you went to
      see about a plot for the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my friend. Still, DO you know what I went there for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course I cannot tell, barin,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice seemed to me so kind that I decided to edify him by relating the
      cause of my expedition, and even telling him of the feeling which I had
      experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo;&mdash;and I told him all, as
      well as inflicted upon him a description of my fine sentiments. To this
      day I blush at the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the cabman non-committally, and for a long while
      afterwards he remained silent and motionless, except that at intervals he
      adjusted the skirt of his coat each time that it was jerked from beneath
      his leg by the joltings of his huge boot on the drozhki&rsquo;s step. I felt
      sure that he must be thinking of me even as the priest had done. That is
      to say, that he must be thinking that no such fine-spirited young man
      existed in the world as I. Suddenly he shot at me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what, barin. You ought to keep God&rsquo;s affairs to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those affairs of yours&mdash;they are God&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; he repeated,
      mumbling the words with his toothless lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he has not understood me,&rdquo; I thought to myself, and said no more to
      him till we reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was not my original sense of reconciliation and reverence, but
      only a sort of complacency at having experienced such a sense, that lasted
      in me during the drive home (and that, too, despite the distraction of the
      crowds of people who now thronged the sunlit streets in every direction),
      I had no sooner reached home than even my spurious complacency was
      shattered, for I found that I had not the forty copecks wherewith to pay
      the cabman! To the butler, Gabriel, I already owed a small debt, and he
      refused to lend me any more. Seeing me twice run across the courtyard in
      quest of the money, the cabman must have divined the reason, for, leaping
      from his drozhki, he&mdash;notwithstanding that he had seemed so kind&mdash;began
      to bawl aloud (with an evident desire to punch my head) that people who do
      not pay for their cab-rides are swindlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of my family were yet out of bed, so that, except for the servants,
      there was no one from whom to borrow the forty copecks. At length, on my
      most sacred, sacred word of honour to repay (a word to which, as I could
      see from his face, he did not altogether trust), Basil so far yielded to
      his fondness for me and his remembrance of the many services I had done
      him as to pay the cabman. Thus all my beautiful feelings ended in smoke.
      When I went upstairs to dress for church and go to Communion with the rest
      I found that my new clothes had not yet come home, and so I could not wear
      them. Then I sinned headlong. Donning my other suit, I went to Communion
      in a sad state of mental perturbation, and filled with complete distrust
      of all my finer impulses.

    <h2>
      IX. HOW I PREPARED MYSELF FOR THE EXAMINATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the Thursday in Easter week Papa, my sister, Katenka, and Mimi went
      away into the country, and no one remained in my grandmother&rsquo;s great house
      but Woloda, St. Jerome, and myself. The frame of mind which I had
      experienced on the day of my confession and during my subsequent
      expedition to the monastery had now completely passed away, and left
      behind it only a dim, though pleasing, memory which daily became more and
      more submerged by the impressions of this emancipated existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The folio endorsed &ldquo;Rules of My Life&rdquo; lay concealed beneath a pile of
      school-books. Although the idea of the possibility of framing rules, for
      every occasion in my life and always letting myself be guided by them
      still pleased me (since it appeared an idea at once simple and
      magnificent, and I was determined to make practical application of it), I
      seemed somehow to have forgotten to put it into practice at once, and kept
      deferring doing so until such and such a moment. At the same time, I took
      pleasure in the thought that every idea which now entered my head could be
      allotted precisely to one or other of my three sections of tasks and
      duties&mdash;those for or to God, those for or to my neighbour, and those
      for or to myself. &ldquo;I can always refer everything to them,&rdquo; I said to
      myself, &ldquo;as well as the many, many other ideas which occur to me on one
      subject or another.&rdquo; Yet at this period I often asked myself, &ldquo;Was I
      better and more truthful when I only believed in the power of the human
      intellect, or am I more so now, when I am losing the faculty of developing
      that power, and am in doubt both as to its potency and as to its
      importance?&rdquo; To this I could return no positive answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of freedom, combined with the spring-like feeling of vague
      expectation to which I have referred already, so unsettled me that I could
      not keep myself in hand&mdash;could make none but the sorriest of
      preparations for my University ordeal. Thus I was busy in the schoolroom
      one morning, and fully aware that I must work hard, seeing that to-morrow
      was the day of my examination in a subject of which I had the two whole
      questions still to read up; yet no sooner had a breath of spring come
      wafted through the window than I felt as though there were something quite
      different that I wished to recall to my memory. My hands laid down my
      book, my feet began to move of themselves, and to set me walking up and
      down the room, and my head felt as though some one had suddenly touched in
      it a little spring and set some machine in motion&mdash;so easily and
      swiftly and naturally did all sorts of pleasing fancies of which I could
      catch no more than the radiancy begin coursing through it. Thus one hour,
      two hours, elapsed unperceived. Even if I sat down determinedly to my
      book, and managed to concentrate my whole attention upon what I was
      reading, suddenly there would sound in the corridor the footsteps of a
      woman and the rustle of her dress. Instantly everything would escape my
      mind, and I would find it impossible to remain still any longer, however
      much I knew that the woman could only be either Gasha or my grandmother&rsquo;s
      old sewing-maid moving about in the corridor. &ldquo;Yet suppose it should be
      SHE all at once?&rdquo; I would say to myself. &ldquo;Suppose IT is beginning now, and
      I were to lose it?&rdquo; and, darting out into the corridor, I would find, each
      time, that it was only Gasha. Yet for long enough afterwards I could not
      recall my attention to my studies. A little spring had been touched in my
      head, and a strange mental ferment started afresh. Again, that evening I
      was sitting alone beside a tallow candle in my room. Suddenly I looked up
      for a moment&mdash;to snuff the candle, or to straighten myself in my
      chair&mdash;and at once became aware of nothing but the darkness in the
      corners and the blank of the open doorway. Then, I also became conscious
      how still the house was, and felt as though I could do nothing else than
      go on listening to that stillness, and gazing into the black square of
      that open doorway, and gradually sinking into a brown study as I sat there
      without moving. At intervals, however, I would get up, and go downstairs,
      and begin wandering through the empty rooms. Once I sat a long while in
      the small drawing-room as I listened to Gasha playing &ldquo;The Nightingale&rdquo;
       (with two fingers) on the piano in the large drawing-room, where a
      solitary candle burned. Later, when the moon was bright, I felt obliged to
      get out of bed and to lean out of the window, so that I might gaze into
      the garden, and at the lighted roof of the Shaposnikoff mansion, the
      straight tower of our parish church, and the dark shadows of the fence and
      the lilac-bush where they lay black upon the path. So long did I remain
      there that, when I at length returned to bed, it was ten o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning before I could open my eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, had it not been for the tutors who came to give me lessons, as
      well as for St. Jerome (who at intervals, and very grudgingly, applied a
      spur to my self-conceit) and, most of all, for the desire to figure as
      &ldquo;clever&rdquo; in the eyes of my friend Nechludoff (who looked upon distinctions
      in University examinations as a matter of first-rate importance)&mdash;had
      it not been for all these things, I say, the spring and my new freedom
      would have combined to make me forget everything I had ever learnt, and so
      to go through the examinations to no purpose whatsoever.

    <h2>
      X. THE EXAMINATION IN HISTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the 16th of April I entered, for the first time, and under the wing of
      St. Jerome, the great hall of the University. I had driven there with St.
      Jerome in our smart phaeton and wearing the first frockcoat of my life,
      while the whole of my other clothes&mdash;even down to my socks and linen&mdash;were
      new and of a grander sort. When a Swiss waiter relieved me of my
      greatcoat, and I stood before him in all the beauty of my attire, I felt
      almost sorry to dazzle him so. Yet I had no sooner entered the bright,
      carpeted, crowded hall, and caught sight of hundreds of other young men in
      gymnasium [The Russian gymnasium = the English grammar or secondary
      school.] uniforms or frockcoats (of whom but a few threw me an indifferent
      glance), as well as, at the far end, of some solemn-looking professors who
      were seated on chairs or walking carelessly about among some tables, than
      I at once became disabused of the notion that I should attract the general
      attention, while the expression of my face, which at home, and even in the
      vestibule of the University buildings, had denoted only a kind of vague
      regret that I should have to present so important and distinguished an
      appearance, became exchanged for an expression of the most acute
      nervousness and dejection. However, I soon picked up again when I
      perceived sitting at one of the desks a very badly, untidily dressed
      gentleman who, though not really old, was almost entirely grey. He was
      occupying a seat quite at the back of the hall and a little apart from the
      rest, so I hastened to sit down beside him, and then fell to looking at
      the candidates for examination, and to forming conclusions about them.
      Many different figures and faces were there to be seen there; yet, in my
      opinion, they all seemed to divide themselves into three classes. First of
      all, there were youths like myself, attending for examination in the
      company of their parents or tutors. Among such I could see the youngest
      Iwin (accompanied by Frost) and Ilinka Grap (accompanied by his old
      father). All youths of this class wore the early beginnings of beards,
      sported prominent linen, sat quietly in their places, and never opened the
      books and notebooks which they had brought with them, but gazed at the
      professors and examination tables with ill-concealed nervousness. The
      second class of candidates were young men in gymnasium uniforms. Several
      of them had attained to the dignity of shaving, and most of them knew one
      another. They talked loudly, called the professors by their names and
      surnames, occupied themselves in getting their subjects ready, exchanged
      notebooks, climbed over desks, fetched themselves pies and sandwiches from
      the vestibule, and ate them then and there merely lowering their heads to
      the level of a desk for propriety&rsquo;s sake. Lastly, the third class of
      candidates (which seemed a small one) consisted of oldish men&mdash;some
      of them in frock coats, but the majority in jackets, and with no linen to
      be seen. These preserved a serious demeanour, sat by themselves, and had a
      very dingy look. The man who had afforded me consolation by being worse
      dressed than myself belonged to this class. Leaning forward upon his
      elbows, and running his fingers through his grey, dishevelled hair as he
      read some book or another, he had thrown me only a momentary glance&mdash;and
      that not a very friendly one&mdash;from a pair of glittering eyes. Then,
      as I sat down, he had frowned grimly, and stuck a shiny elbow out to
      prevent me from coming any nearer. On the other hand, the gymnasium men
      were over-sociable, and I felt rather afraid of their proximity. One of
      them did not hesitate to thrust a book into my hands, saying, &ldquo;Give that
      to that fellow over there, will you?&rdquo; while another of them exclaimed as
      he pushed past me, &ldquo;By your leave, young fellow!&rdquo; and a third made use of
      my shoulder as a prop when he wanted to scramble over a desk. All this
      seemed to me a little rough and unpleasant, for I looked upon myself as
      immensely superior to such fellows, and considered that they ought not to
      treat me with such familiarity. At length, the names began to be called
      out. The gymnasium men walked out boldly, answered their questions
      (apparently) well, and came back looking cheerful. My own class of
      candidates were much more diffident, as well as appeared to answer worse.
      Of the oldish men, some answered well, and some very poorly. When the name
      &ldquo;Semenoff&rdquo; was called out my neighbour with the grey hair and glittering
      eyes jostled me roughly, stepped over my legs, and went up to one of the
      examiners&rsquo; tables. It was plain from the aspect of the professors that he
      answered well and with assurance, yet, on returning to his place, he did
      not wait to see where he was placed on the list, but quietly collected his
      notebooks and departed. Several times I shuddered at the sound of the
      voice calling out the names, but my turn did not come in exact
      alphabetical order, though already names had begun to be called beginning
      with &ldquo;I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ikonin and Tenieff!&rdquo; suddenly shouted some one from the professors&rsquo; end
      of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Ikonin! You are being called,&rdquo; said a tall, red-faced gymnasium
      student near me. &ldquo;But who is this BARtenieff or MORtenieff or somebody? I
      don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be you,&rdquo; whispered St. Jerome loudly in my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY name is IRtenieff,&rdquo; I said to the red-faced student. &ldquo;Do you think
      that was the name they were calling out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why on earth don&rsquo;t you go up?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Lord, what a dandy!&rdquo; he
      added under his breath, yet not so quietly but that I failed to hear the
      words as they came wafted to me from below the desk. In front of me walked
      Ikonin&mdash;a tall young man of about twenty-five, who was one of those
      whom I had classed as oldish men. He wore a tight brown frockcoat and a
      blue satin tie, and had wisps of flaxen hair carefully brushed over his
      collar in the peasant style. His appearance had already caught my
      attention when we were sitting among the desks, and had given me an
      impression that he was not bad-looking. Also I had noticed that he was
      very talkative. Yet what struck me most about his physiognomy was a tuft,
      of queer red hairs which he had under his chin, as well as, still more, a
      strange habit of continually unbuttoning his waistcoat and scratching his
      chest under his shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the table to which we were summoned sat three Professors, none of
      whom acknowledged our salutations. A youngish professor was shuffling a
      bundle of tickets like a pack of cards; another one, with a star on his
      frockcoat, was gazing hard at a gymnasium student, who was repeating
      something at great speed about Charles the Great, and adding to each of
      his sentences the word nakonetz [= the English colloquialism &ldquo;you know.&rdquo;]
      while a third one&mdash;an old man in spectacles&mdash;proceeded to bend
      his head down as we approached, and, peering at us through his glasses,
      pointed silently to the tickets. I felt his glance go over both myself and
      Ikonin, and also felt sure that something about us had displeased him
      (perhaps it was Ikonin&rsquo;s red hairs), for, after taking another look at the
      pair of us, he motioned impatiently to us to be quick in taking our
      tickets. I felt vexed and offended&mdash;firstly, because none of the
      professors had responded to our bows, and, secondly, because they
      evidently coupled me with Ikonin under the one denomination of
      &ldquo;candidates,&rdquo; and so were condemning me in advance on account of Ikonin&rsquo;s
      red hairs. I took my ticket boldly and made ready to answer, but the
      professor&rsquo;s eye passed over my head and alighted upon Ikonin. Accordingly,
      I occupied myself in reading my ticket. The questions printed on it were
      all familiar to me, so, as I silently awaited my turn, I gazed at what was
      passing near me, Ikonin seemed in no way diffident&mdash;rather the
      reverse, for, in reaching for his ticket, he threw his body half-way
      across the table. Then he gave his long hair a shake, and rapidly conned
      over what was written on his ticket. I think he had just opened his mouth
      to answer when the professor with the star dismissed the gymnasium student
      with a word of commendation, and then turned and looked at Ikonin. At once
      the latter seemed taken back, and stopped short. For about two minutes
      there was a dead silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the professor in the spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Ikonin opened his mouth, and once more remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! You are not the only one to be examined. Do you mean to answer or
      do you not?&rdquo; said the youngish professor, but Ikonin did not even look at
      him. He was gazing fixedly at his ticket and uttered not a single word.
      The professor in the spectacles scanned him through his glasses, then over
      them, then without them (for, indeed, he had time to take them off, to
      wipe their lenses carefully, and to replace them). Still not a word from
      Ikonin. All at once, however, a smile spread itself over his face, and he
      gave his long hair another shake. Next he reached across the table, laid
      down his ticket, looked at each of the professors in turn and then at
      myself, and finally, wheeling round on his heels, made a gesture with his
      hand and returned to the desks. The professors stared blankly at one
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless the fellow!&rdquo; said the youngish professor. &ldquo;What an original!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now my turn to move towards the table, but the professors went on
      talking in undertones among themselves, as though they were unaware of my
      presence. At the moment, I felt firmly persuaded that the three of them
      were engrossed solely with the question of whether I should merely PASS
      the examination or whether I should pass it WELL, and that it was only
      swagger which made them pretend that they did not care either way, and
      behave as though they had not seen me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length the professor in the spectacles turned to me with an air of
      indifference, and invited me to answer, I felt hurt, as I looked at him,
      to think that he should have so undeceived me: wherefore I answered
      brokenly at first. In time, however, things came easier to my tongue, and,
      inasmuch as all the questions bore upon Russian history (which I knew
      thoroughly), I ended with eclat, and even went so far, in my desire to
      convince the professors that I was not Ikonin and that they must not in
      anyway confound me with him, as to offer to draw a second ticket. The
      professor in the spectacles, however, merely nodded his head, said &ldquo;That
      will do,&rdquo; and marked something in his register. On returning to the desks,
      I at once learnt from the gymnasium men (who somehow seemed to know
      everything) that I had been placed fifth.

    <h2>
      XI. MY EXAMINATION IN MATHEMATICS
    </h2>
    <p>
      AT the subsequent examinations, I made several new acquaintances in
      addition to the Graps (whom I considered unworthy of my notice) and Iwin
      (who for some reason or other avoided me). With some of these new friends
      I grew quite intimate, and even Ikonin plucked up sufficient courage to
      inform me, when we next met, that he would have to undergo re-examination
      in history&mdash;the reason for his failure this time being that the
      professor of that faculty had never forgiven him for last year&rsquo;s
      examination, and had, indeed, &ldquo;almost killed&rdquo; him for it. Semenoff (who
      was destined for the same faculty as myself&mdash;the faculty of
      mathematics) avoided every one up to the very close of the examinations.
      Always leaning forward upon his elbows and running his fingers through his
      grey hair, he sat silent and alone. Nevertheless, when called up for
      examination in mathematics (he had no companion to accompany him), he came
      out second. The first place was taken by a student from the first
      gymnasium&mdash;a tall, dark, lanky, pale-faced fellow who wore a black
      folded cravat and had his cheeks and forehead dotted all over with
      pimples. His hands were shapely and slender, but their nails were so
      bitten to the quick that the finger-ends looked as though they had been
      tied round with strips of thread. All this seemed to me splendid, and
      wholly becoming to a student of the first gymnasium. He spoke to every
      one, and we all made friends with him. To me in particular his walk, his
      every movement, his lips, his dark eyes, all seemed to have in them
      something extraordinary and magnetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of the mathematical examination I arrived earlier than usual at
      the hall. I knew the syllabus well, yet there were two questions in the
      algebra which my tutor had managed to pass over, and which were therefore
      quite unknown to me. If I remember rightly, they were the Theory of
      Combinations and Newton&rsquo;s Binomial. I seated myself on one of the back
      benches and pored over the two questions, but, inasmuch as I was not
      accustomed to working in a noisy room, and had even less time for
      preparation than I had anticipated, I soon found it difficult to take in
      all that I was reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is. This way, Nechludoff,&rdquo; said Woloda&rsquo;s familiar voice behind
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned and saw my brother and Dimitri&mdash;their gowns unbuttoned, and
      their hands waving a greeting to me&mdash;threading their way through the
      desks. A moment&rsquo;s glance would have sufficed to show any one that they
      were second-course students&mdash;persons to whom the University was as a
      second home. The mere look of their open gowns expressed at once disdain
      for the &ldquo;mere candidate&rdquo; and a knowledge that the &ldquo;mere candidate&rsquo;s&rdquo; soul
      was filled with envy and admiration of them. I was charmed to think that
      every one near me could now see that I knew two real second-course
      students: wherefore I hastened to meet them half-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Woloda, of course, could not help vaunting his superiority a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, you smug!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been examined yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are you reading? Aren&rsquo;t you sufficiently primed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, except in two questions. I don&rsquo;t understand them at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what?&rdquo;&mdash;and Woloda straightway began to expound to me Newton&rsquo;s
      Binomial, but so rapidly and unintelligibly that, suddenly reading in my
      eyes certain misgivings as to the soundness of his knowledge, he glanced
      also at Dimitri&rsquo;s face. Clearly, he saw the same misgivings there, for he
      blushed hotly, though still continuing his involved explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; hold on, Woloda, and let me try and do it,&rdquo; put in Dimitri at length,
      with a glance at the professors&rsquo; corner as he seated himself beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could see that my friend was in the best of humours. This was always the
      case with him when he was satisfied with himself, and was one of the
      things in him which I liked best. Inasmuch as he knew mathematics well and
      could speak clearly, he hammered the question so thoroughly into my head
      that I can remember it to this day. Hardly had he finished when St. Jerome
      said to me in a loud whisper, &ldquo;A vous, Nicolas,&rdquo; and I followed Ikonin out
      from among the desks without having had an opportunity of going through
      the OTHER question of which I was ignorant. At the table which we now
      approached were seated two professors, while before the blackboard stood a
      gymnasium student, who was working some formula aloud, and knocking bits
      off the end of the chalk with his too vigorous strokes. He even continued
      writing after one of the Professors had said to him &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; and bidden
      us draw our tickets. &ldquo;Suppose I get the Theory of Combinations?&rdquo; I thought
      to myself as my tremulous fingers took a ticket from among a bundle
      wrapped in torn paper. Ikonin, for his part, reached across the table with
      the same assurance, and the same sidelong movement of his whole body, as
      he had done at the previous examination. Taking the topmost ticket without
      troubling to make further selection, he just glanced at it, and then
      frowned angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always draw this kind of thing,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at mine. Horrors! It was the Theory of Combinations!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got?&rdquo; whispered Ikonin at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I showed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you make an exchange, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Besides, it would be all the same for me if I did,&rdquo; he contrived to
      whisper just as the professor called us up to the blackboard. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      feel up to anything to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then everything is lost!&rdquo; I thought to myself. Instead of the brilliant
      result which I had anticipated I should be for ever covered with shame&mdash;more
      so even than Ikonin! Suddenly, under the very eyes of the professor,
      Ikonin turned to me, snatched my ticket out of my hands, and handed me his
      own. I looked at his ticket. It was Newton&rsquo;s Binomial!
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor was a youngish man, with a pleasant, clever expression of
      face&mdash;an effect chiefly due to the prominence of the lower part of
      his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Are you exchanging tickets, gentlemen?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He only gave me his to look at, professor,&rdquo; answered Ikonin&mdash;and,
      sure enough, the word &ldquo;professor&rdquo; was the last word that he uttered there.
      Once again, he stepped backwards towards me from the table, once again he
      looked at each of the professors in turn and then at myself, once again he
      smiled faintly, and once again he shrugged his shoulders as much as to
      say, &ldquo;It is no use, my good sirs.&rdquo; Then he returned to the desks.
      Subsequently, I learnt that this was the third year he had vainly
      attempted to matriculate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered my question well, for I had just read it up; and the professor,
      kindly informing me that I had done even better than was required, placed
      me fifth.

    <h2>
      XII. MY EXAMINATION IN LATIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      All went well until my examination in Latin. So far, a gymnasium student
      stood first on the list, Semenoff second, and myself third. On the
      strength of it I had begun to swagger a little, and to think that, for all
      my youth, I was not to be despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first day of the examinations, I had heard every one speak with
      awe of the Professor of Latin, who appeared to be some sort of a wild
      beast who battened on the financial ruin of young men (of those, that is
      to say, who paid their own fees) and spoke only in the Greek and Latin
      tongues. However, St. Jerome, who had coached me in Latin, spoke
      encouragingly, and I myself thought that, since I could translate Cicero
      and certain parts of Horace without the aid of a lexicon, I should do no
      worse than the rest. Yet things proved otherwise. All the morning the air
      had been full of rumours concerning the tribulations of candidates who had
      gone up before me: rumours of how one young fellow had been accorded a
      nought, another one a single mark only, a third one greeted with abuse and
      threatened with expulsion, and so forth. Only Semenoff and the first
      gymnasium student had, as usual, gone up quietly, and returned to their
      seats with five marks credited to their names. Already I felt a prescience
      of disaster when Ikonin and myself found ourselves summoned to the little
      table at which the terrible professor sat in solitary grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrible professor turned out to be a little thin, bilious-looking man
      with hair long and greasy and a face expressive of extraordinary
      sullenness. Handing Ikonin a copy of Cicero&rsquo;s Orations, he bid him
      translate. To my great astonishment Ikonin not only read off some of the
      Latin, but even managed to construe a few lines to the professor&rsquo;s
      prompting. At the same time, conscious of my superiority over such a
      feeble companion, I could not help smiling a little, and even looking
      rather contemptuous, when it came to a question of analysis, and Ikonin,
      as on previous occasions, plunged into a silence which promised never to
      end. I had hoped to please the professor by that knowing, slightly
      sarcastic smile of mine, but, as a matter of fact, I contrived to do quite
      the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently you know better than he, since you are laughing,&rdquo; he said to me
      in bad Russian. &ldquo;Well, we shall see. Tell me the answer, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later I learnt that the professor was Ikonin&rsquo;s guardian, and that Ikonin
      actually lived with him. I lost no time in answering the question in
      syntax which had been put to Ikonin, but the professor only pulled a long
      face and turned away from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your turn will come presently, and then we shall see how much you
      know,&rdquo; he remarked, without looking at me, but proceeding to explain to
      Ikonin the point on which he had questioned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; he added, and I saw him put down four marks to Ikonin in
      his register. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; I thought to myself. &ldquo;He cannot be so strict after
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Ikonin had taken his departure the professor spent fully five minutes&mdash;five
      minutes which seemed to me five hours&mdash;in setting his books and
      tickets in order, in blowing his nose, in adjusting and sprawling about on
      his chair, in gazing down the hall, and in looking here, there, and
      everywhere&mdash;in doing everything, in fact, except once letting his eye
      rest upon me. Yet even that amount of dissimulation did not seem to
      satisfy him, for he next opened a book, and pretended to read it, for all
      the world as though I were not there at all. I moved a little nearer him,
      and gave a cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! You too, of course! Well, translate me something,&rdquo; he remarked,
      handing me a book of some kind. &ldquo;But no; you had better take this,&rdquo; and,
      turning over the leaves of a Horace, he indicated to me a passage which I
      should never have imagined possible of translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not prepared this,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Then you only wish to answer things which you have got by heart, do
      you? Indeed? No, no; translate me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started to grope for the meaning of the passage, but each questioning
      look which I threw at the professor was met by a shake of the head, a
      profound sigh, and an exclamation of &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Finally he banged the book
      to with such a snap that he caught his finger between the covers. Angrily
      releasing it, he handed me a ticket containing questions in grammar, and,
      flinging himself back in his chair, maintained a menacing silence. I
      should have tried to answer the questions had not the expression of his
      face so clogged my tongue that nothing seemed to come from it right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! That&rsquo;s not it at all!&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed in his horrible
      accent as he altered his posture to one of leaning forward upon the table
      and playing with the gold signet-ring which was nearly slipping from the
      little finger of his left hand. &ldquo;That is not the way to prepare for
      serious study, my good sir. Fellows like yourself think that, once they
      have a gown and a blue collar to their backs, they have reached the summit
      of all things and become students. No, no, my dear sir. A subject needs to
      be studied FUNDAMENTALLY,&rdquo; and so on, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this speech (which was uttered with a clipped sort of intonation) I
      went on staring dully at his lowered eyelids. Beginning with a fear lest I
      should lose my place as third on the list, I went on to fear lest I should
      pass at all. Next, these feelings became reinforced by a sense of
      injustice, injured self-respect, and unmerited humiliation, while the
      contempt which I felt for the professor as some one not quite (according
      to my ideas) &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo;&mdash;a fact which I deduced from the
      shortness, strength, and roundness of his nails&mdash;flared up in me more
      and more and turned all my other feelings to sheer animosity. Happening,
      presently, to glance at me, and to note my quivering lips and tear-filled
      eyes, he seemed to interpret my agitation as a desire to be accorded my
      marks and dismissed: wherefore, with an air of relenting, he said (in the
      presence of another professor who had just approached):
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I will accord you a &lsquo;pass&rsquo;&rdquo; (which signified two marks),
      &ldquo;although you do not deserve it. I do so simply out of consideration for
      your youth, and in the hope that, when you begin your University career,
      you will learn to be less light-minded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The concluding phrase, uttered in the hearing of the other professor (who
      at once turned his eyes upon me, as though remarking, &ldquo;There! You see,
      young man!&rdquo;) completed my discomfiture. For a moment, a mist swam before
      my eyes&mdash;a mist in which the terrible professor seemed to be far
      away, as he sat at his table while for an instant a wild idea danced
      through my brain. &ldquo;What if I DID do such a thing?&rdquo; I thought to myself.
      &ldquo;What would come of it?&rdquo; However, I did not do the thing in question, but,
      on the contrary, made a bow of peculiar reverence to each of the
      professors, and with a slight smile on my face&mdash;presumably the same
      smile as that with which I had derided Ikonin&mdash;turned away from the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      This piece of unfairness affected me so powerfully at the time that, had I
      been a free agent, I should have attended for no more examinations. My
      ambition was gone (since now I could not possibly be third), and I
      therefore let the other examinations pass without any exertion, or even
      agitation, on my part. In the general list I still stood fourth, but that
      failed to interest me, since I had reasoned things out to myself, and come
      to the conclusion that to try for first place was stupid&mdash;even &ldquo;bad
      form:&rdquo; that, in fact, it was better to pass neither very well nor very
      badly, as Woloda had done. This attitude I decided to maintain throughout
      the whole of my University career, notwithstanding that it was the first
      point on which my opinion had differed from that of my friend Dimitri.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, to tell the truth, my thoughts were already turning towards a
      uniform, a &ldquo;mortar-board,&rdquo; and the possession of a drozhki of my own, a
      room of my own, and, above all, freedom of my own. And certainly the
      prospect had its charm.

    <h2>
      XIII. I BECOME GROWN-UP
    </h2>
    <p>
      When, on May 8th, I returned home from the final, the divinity,
      examination, I found my acquaintance, the foreman from Rozonoff&rsquo;s,
      awaiting me. He had called once before to fit me for my gown, as well as
      for a tunic of glossy black cloth (the lapels of which were, on that
      occasion, only sketched in chalk), but to-day he had come to bring me the
      clothes in their finished state, with their gilt buttons wrapped in tissue
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donning the garments, and finding them splendid (notwithstanding that St.
      Jerome assured me that the back of the tunic wrinkled badly), I went
      downstairs with a complacent smile which I was powerless to banish from my
      face, and sought Woloda, trying the while to affect unconsciousness of the
      admiring looks of the servants, who came darting out of the hall and
      corridor to gaze upon me with ravished eyes. Gabriel, the butler, overtook
      me in the salle, and, after congratulating me with much empressement,
      handed me, according to instructions from my father, four bank-notes, as
      well as informed me that Papa had also given orders that, from that day
      forth, the groom Kuzma, the phaeton, and the bay horse Krassavchik were to
      be entirely at my disposal. I was so overjoyed at this not altogether
      expected good-fortune that I could no longer feign indifference in
      Gabriel&rsquo;s presence, but, flustered and panting, said the first thing which
      came into my head (&ldquo;Krassavchik is a splendid trotter,&rdquo; I think it was).
      Then, catching sight of the various heads protruding from the doors of the
      hall and corridor, I felt that I could bear no more, and set off running
      at full speed across the salle, dressed as I was in the new tunic, with
      its shining gilt buttons. Just as I burst into Woloda&rsquo;s room, I heard
      behind me the voices of Dubkoff and Nechludoff, who had come to
      congratulate me, as well as to propose a dinner somewhere and the drinking
      of much champagne in honour of my matriculation. Dimitri informed me that,
      though he did not care for champagne, he would nevertheless join us that
      evening and drink my health, while Dubkoff remarked that I looked almost
      like a colonel, and Woloda omitted to congratulate me at all, merely
      saying in an acid way that he supposed we should now&mdash;i.e. in two
      days time&mdash;be off into the country. The truth was that Woloda, though
      pleased at my matriculation, did not altogether like my becoming as
      grown-up as himself. St. Jerome, who also joined us at this moment, said
      in a very pompous manner that his duties were now ended, and that,
      although he did not know whether they had been well done or ill, at least
      he had done his best, and must depart to-morrow to his Count&rsquo;s. In
      replying to their various remarks I could feel, in spite of myself, a
      pleased, agreeable, faintly self-sufficient smile playing over my
      countenance, as well as could remark that that smile, communicated itself
      to those to whom I was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here was I without a tutor, yet with my own private drozhki, my name
      printed on the list of students, a sword and belt of my own, and a chance
      of an occasional salute from officials! In short, I was grownup and, I
      suppose, happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we arranged to go out and dine at five o&rsquo;clock, but since Woloda
      presently went off to Dubkoff&rsquo;s, and Dimitri disappeared in his usual
      fashion (saying that there was something he MUST do before dinner), I was
      left with two whole hours still at my disposal. For a time I walked
      through the rooms of the house, and looked at myself in all the mirrors&mdash;firstly
      with the tunic buttoned, then with it unbuttoned, and lastly with only the
      top button fastened. Each time it looked splendid. Eventually, though
      anxious not to show any excess of delight, I found myself unable to
      refrain from crossing over to the coach-house and stables to gaze at
      Krassovchik, Kuzma, and the drozhki. Then I returned and once more began
      my tour of the rooms, where I looked at myself in all the mirrors as
      before, and counted my money over in my pocket&mdash;my face smiling
      happily the while. Yet not an hour had elapsed before I began to feel
      slightly ennuye&mdash;to feel a shade of regret that no one was present to
      see me in my splendid position. I began to long for life and movement, and
      so sent out orders for the drozhki to be got ready, since I had made up my
      mind to drive to the Kuznetski Bridge and make some purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this connection I recalled how, after matriculating, Woloda had gone
      and bought himself a lithograph of horses by Victor Adam and some pipes
      and tobacco: wherefore I felt that I too must do the same. Amid glances
      showered upon me from every side, and with the sunlight reflected from my
      buttons, cap-badge, and sword, I drove to the Kuznetski Bridge, where,
      halting at a Picture shop, I entered it with my eyes looking to every
      side. It was not precisely horses by Adam which I meant to buy, since I
      did not wish to be accused of too closely imitating Woloda; wherefore, out
      of shame for causing the obsequious shopmen such agitation as I appeared
      to do, I made a hasty selection, and pitched upon a water-colour of a
      woman&rsquo;s head which I saw displayed in the window&mdash;price twenty
      roubles. Yet no sooner had I paid the twenty roubles over the counter than
      my heart smote me for having put two such beautifully dressed
      shop-assistants to so much trouble for such a trifle. Moreover, I fancied
      that they were regarding me with some disdain. Accordingly, in my desire
      to show them what manner of man I was, I turned my attention to a silver
      trifle which I saw displayed in a show-case, and, recognising that it was
      a porte-crayon (price eighteen roubles), requested that it should
      forthwith be wrapped in paper for me. Next, the money paid, and the
      information acquired that splendid pipes and tobacco were to be obtained
      in an adjacent emporium, I bowed to the two shopmen politely, and issued
      into the street with the picture under my arm. At the shop next door
      (which had painted on its sign-board a negro smoking a cigar) I bought
      (likewise out of a desire to imitate no one) some Turkish tobacco, a
      Stamboul hookah, and two pipes. On coming out of the shop, I had just
      entered the drozhki when I caught sight of Semenoff, who was walking
      hurriedly along the pavement with his head bent down. Vexed that he should
      not have recognised me, I called out to him pretty loudly, &ldquo;Hold on a
      minute!&rdquo; and, whipping up the drozhki, soon overtook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My respects to you,&rdquo; he replied, but without stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you not in your University uniform?&rdquo; I next inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this he stopped short with a frown, and parted his white teeth as
      though the sun were hurting his eyes. The next moment, however, he threw a
      glance of studied indifference at my drozhki and uniform, and continued on
      his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Kuznetski Bridge, I drove to a confectioner&rsquo;s in Tverskaia
      Street, and, much as I should have liked it to be supposed that it was the
      newspapers which most interested me, I had no choice but to begin falling
      upon tartlet after tartlet. In fact, for all my bashfulness before a
      gentleman who kept regarding me with some curiosity from behind a
      newspaper, I ate with great swiftness a tartlet of each of the eight
      different sorts which the confectioner kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching home, I experienced a slight touch of stomach-ache, but paid
      no attention to it, and set to work to inspect my purchases. Of these, the
      picture so much displeased me that, instead of having it framed and hung
      in my room, as Woloda had done with his, I took pains to hide it behind a
      chest of drawers, where no one could see it. Likewise, though I also found
      the porte-crayon distasteful, I was able, as I laid it on my table, to
      comfort myself with the thought that it was at least a SILVER article&mdash;so
      much capital, as it were&mdash;and likely to be very useful to a student.
      As for the smoking things, I decided to put them into use at once, and try
      their capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsealing the four packages, and carefully filling the Stamboul pipe with
      some fine-cut, reddish-yellow Turkish tobacco, I applied a hot cinder to
      it, and, taking the mouthpiece between my first and second fingers (a
      position of the hand which greatly caught my fancy), started to inhale the
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smell of the tobacco seemed delightful, yet something burnt my mouth
      and caught me by the breath. Nevertheless, I hardened my heart, and
      continued to draw abundant fumes into my interior. Then I tried blowing
      rings and retaining the smoke. Soon the room became filled with blue
      vapours, while the pipe started to crackle and the tobacco to fly out in
      sparks. Presently, also, I began to feel a smarting in my mouth and a
      giddiness in my head. Accordingly, I was on the point of stopping and
      going to look at myself and my pipe in the mirror, when, to my surprise, I
      found myself staggering about. The room was whirling round and round, and
      as I peered into the mirror (which I reached only with some difficulty) I
      perceived that my face was as white as a sheet. Hardly had I thrown myself
      down upon a sofa when such nausea and faintness swept over me that, making
      up my mind that the pipe had proved my death, I expected every moment to
      expire. Terribly frightened, I tried to call out for some one to come and
      help me, and to send for the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this panic of mine did not last long, for I soon understood what
      the matter with me was, and remained lying on the sofa with a racking
      headache and my limbs relaxed as I stared dully at the stamp on the
      package of tobacco, the Pipe-tube coiled on the floor, and the odds and
      ends of tobacco and confectioner&rsquo;s tartlets which were littered about.
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; I thought to myself in my dejection and disillusionment, &ldquo;I
      cannot be quite grown-up if I cannot smoke as other fellows do, and should
      be fated never to hold a chibouk between my first and second fingers, or
      to inhale and puff smoke through a flaxen moustache!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dimitri called for me at five o&rsquo;clock, he found me in this unpleasant
      predicament. After drinking a glass of water, however, I felt nearly
      recovered, and ready to go with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for your trying to smoke!&rdquo; said he as he gazed at the remnants of
      my debauch. &ldquo;It is a silly thing to do, and waste of money as well. I long
      ago promised myself never to smoke. But come along; we have to call for
      Dubkoff.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XIV. HOW WOLODA AND DUBKOFF AMUSED THEMSELVES
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE moment that Dimitri entered my room I perceived from his face, manner
      of walking, and the signs which, in him, denoted ill-humour&mdash;a
      blinking of the eyes and a grim holding of his head to one side, as though
      to straighten his collar&mdash;that he was in the coldly-correct frame of
      mind which was his when he felt dissatisfied with himself. It was a frame
      of mind, too, which always produced a chilling effect upon my feelings
      towards him. Of late I had begun to observe and appraise my friend&rsquo;s
      character a little more, but our friendship had in no way suffered from
      that, since it was still too young and strong for me to be able to look
      upon Dimitri as anything but perfect, no matter in what light I regarded
      him. In him there were two personalities, both of which I thought
      beautiful. One, which I loved devotedly, was kind, mild, forgiving, gay,
      and conscious of being those various things. When he was in this frame of
      mind his whole exterior, the very tone of his voice, his every movement,
      appeared to say: &ldquo;I am kind and good-natured, and rejoice in being so, and
      every one can see that I so rejoice.&rdquo; The other of his two personalities&mdash;one
      which I had only just begun to apprehend, and before the majesty of which
      I bowed in spirit&mdash;was that of a man who was cold, stern to himself
      and to others, proud, religious to the point of fanaticism, and
      pedantically moral. At the present moment he was, as I say, this second
      personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that frankness which constituted a necessary condition of our
      relations I told him, as soon as we entered the drozhki, how much it
      depressed and hurt me to see him, on this my fete-day in a frame of mind
      so irksome and disagreeable to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has upset you so?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;Will you not tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Nicolas,&rdquo; was his slow reply as he gave his head a nervous twitch
      to one side and blinked his eyes, &ldquo;since I have given you my word never to
      conceal anything from you, you have no reason to suspect me of
      secretiveness. One cannot always be in exactly the same mood, and if I
      seem at all put out, that is all there is to say about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a marvellously open, honourable character his is!&rdquo; I thought to
      myself, and dropped the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove the rest of the way to Dubkoff&rsquo;s in silence. Dubkoff&rsquo;s flat was
      an unusually fine one&mdash;or, at all events, so it seemed to me.
      Everywhere were rugs, pictures, gardenias, striped hangings, photographs,
      and curved settees, while on the walls hung guns, pistols, pouches, and
      the mounted heads of wild beasts. It was the appearance of this apartment
      which made me aware whom, it was that Woloda had imitated in the scheme of
      his own sitting-room. We found Dubkoff and Woloda engaged in cards, while
      seated also at the table, and watching the game with close attention, was
      a gentleman whom I did not know, but who appeared to be of no great
      importance, judging by the modesty of his attitude. Dubkoff himself was in
      a silk dressing-gown and soft slippers, while Woloda&mdash;seated opposite
      him on a divan&mdash;was in his shirtsleeves, as well as (to judge by his
      flushed face and the impatient, cursory glance which he gave us for a
      second as he looked up from the cards) much taken up with the game. On
      seeing me, he reddened still more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is for you to deal,&rdquo; he remarked to Dubkoff. In an instant I
      divined that he did not altogether relish my becoming acquainted with the
      fact that he gambled. Yet his expression had nothing in it of confusion&mdash;only
      a look which seemed to me to say: &ldquo;Yes, I play cards, and if you are
      surprised at that, it is only because you are so young. There is nothing
      wrong about it&mdash;it is a necessity at our age.&rdquo; Yes, I at once divined
      and understood that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of dealing, however, Dubkoff rose and shook hands with us; after
      which he bade us both be seated, and then offered us pipes, which we
      declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is our DIPLOMAT, then&mdash;the hero of the day!&rdquo; he said to me,
      &ldquo;Good Lord! how you look like a colonel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-m!&rdquo; I muttered in reply, though once more feeling a complacent smile
      overspread my countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood in that awe of Dubkoff which a sixteen-year-old boy naturally
      feels for a twenty-seven-year-old man of whom his elders say that he is a
      very clever young man who can dance well and speak French, and who, though
      secretly despising one&rsquo;s youth, endeavours to conceal the fact. Yet,
      despite my respect for him, I somehow found it difficult and
      uncomfortable, throughout my acquaintanceship with him, to look him in the
      eyes, I have since remarked that there are three kinds of men whom I
      cannot face easily, namely those who are much better than myself, those
      who are much worse, and those between whom and myself there is a mutual
      determination not to mention some particular thing of which we are both
      aware. Dubkoff may have been a much better fellow than myself, or he may
      have been a much worse; but the point was that he lied very frequently
      without recognising the fact that I was aware of his doing so, yet had
      determined not to mention it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us play another round,&rdquo; said Woloda, hunching one shoulder after the
      manner of Papa, and reshuffling the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How persistent you are!&rdquo; said Dubkoff. &ldquo;We can play all we want to
      afterwards. Well, one more round, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the play, I looked at their hands. Woloda&rsquo;s hands were large and
      red, whilst in the crook of the thumb and the way in which the other
      fingers curved themselves round the cards as he held them they so exactly
      resembled Papa&rsquo;s that now and then I could not help thinking that Woloda
      purposely held the cards thus so as to look the more like a grownup. Yet
      the next moment, looking at his face, I could see that he had not a
      thought in his mind beyond the game. Dubkoff&rsquo;s hands, on the contrary,
      were small, puffy, and inclined to clench themselves, as well as extremely
      neat and small-fingered. They were just the kind of hands which generally
      display rings, and which are most to be seen on persons who are both
      inclined to use them and fond of objets de vertu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Woloda must have lost, for the gentleman who was watching the play
      remarked that Vladimir Petrovitch had terribly bad luck, while Dubkoff
      reached for a note book, wrote something in it, and then, showing Woloda
      what he had written, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; said Woloda, glancing with feigned carelessness at the note book.
      &ldquo;Now let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Woloda took Dubkoff, and I gave Dimitri a lift in my drozhki.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were they playing at?&rdquo; I inquired of Dimitri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At piquet. It is a stupid game. In fact, all such games are stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were they playing for much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not very much, but more than they ought to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever play yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I swore never to do so; but Dubkoff will play with any one he can get
      hold of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought not to do that,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;So Woloda does not play so well as
      he does?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Dubkoff ought not to, as you say, yet there is nothing especially
      bad about it all. He likes playing, and plays well, but he is a good
      fellow all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea of this,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not think ill of him,&rdquo; concluded Dimitri, &ldquo;since he is a simply
      splendid fellow. I like him very much, and always shall like him, in spite
      of his weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some reason or another the idea occurred to me that, just BECAUSE
      Dimitri stuck up so stoutly for Dubkoff, he neither liked nor respected
      him in reality, but was determined, out of stubbornness and a desire not
      to be accused of inconstancy, never to own to the fact. He was one of
      those people who love their friends their life long, not so much because
      those friends remain always dear to them, as because, having once&mdash;possibly
      mistakenly&mdash;liked a person, they look upon it as dishonourable to
      cease ever to do so.

    <h2>
      XV. I AM FETED AT DINNER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dubkoff and Woloda knew every one at the restaurant by name, and every
      one, from the waiters to the proprietor, paid them great respect. No time
      was lost in allotting us a private room, where a bottle of iced
      champagne-upon which I tried to look with as much indifference as I could&mdash;stood
      ready waiting for us, and where we were served with a most wonderful
      repast selected by Dubkoff from the French menu. The meal went off most
      gaily and agreeably, notwithstanding that Dubkoff, as usual, told us
      blood-curdling tales of doubtful veracity (among others, a tale of how his
      grandmother once shot dead three robbers who were attacking her&mdash;a
      recital at which I blushed, closed my eyes, and turned away from the
      narrator), and that Woloda reddened visibly whenever I opened my mouth to
      speak&mdash;which was the more uncalled for on his part, seeing that never
      once, so far as I can remember, did I say anything shameful. After we had
      been given champagne, every one congratulated me, and I drank &ldquo;hands
      across&rdquo; with Dimitri and Dubkoff, and wished them joy. Since, however, I
      did not know to whom the bottle of champagne belonged (it was explained to
      me later that it was common property), I considered that, in return, I
      ought to treat my friends out of the money which I had never ceased to
      finger in my pocket. Accordingly, I stealthily extracted a ten-rouble
      note, and, beckoning the waiter to my side, handed him the money, and told
      him in a whisper (yet not so softly but that every one could hear me,
      seeing that every one was staring at me in dead silence) to &ldquo;bring, if you
      please, a half-bottle of champagne.&rdquo; At this Woloda reddened again, and
      began to fidget so violently, and to gaze upon myself and every one else
      with such a distracted air, that I felt sure I had somehow put my foot in
      it. However, the half-bottle came, and we drank it with great gusto. After
      that, things went on merrily. Dubkoff continued his unending fairy tales,
      while Woloda also told funny stories&mdash;and told them well, too&mdash;in
      a way I should never have credited him: so that our laughter rang long and
      loud. Their best efforts lay in imitation, and in variants of a certain
      well-known saw. &ldquo;Have you ever been abroad?&rdquo; one would say to the other,
      for instance. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the one interrogated would reply, &ldquo;but my brother
      plays the fiddle.&rdquo; Such perfection had the pair attained in this species
      of comic absurdity that they could answer any question by its means, while
      they would also endeavour to unite two absolutely unconnected matters
      without a previous question having been asked at all, yet say everything
      with a perfectly serious face and produce a most comic effect. I too began
      to try to be funny, but as soon as ever I spoke they either looked at me
      askance or did not look at me until I had finished: so that my anecdotes
      fell flat. Yet, though Dubkoff always remarked, &ldquo;Our DIPLOMAT is lying,
      brother,&rdquo; I felt so exhilarated with the champagne and the company of my
      elders that the remark scarcely touched me. Only Dimitri, though he drank
      level with the rest of us, continued in the same severe, serious frame of
      mind&mdash;a fact which put a certain check upon the general hilarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Dubkoff at last. &ldquo;After dinner we ought
      to take the DIPLOMAT in hand. How would it be for him to go with us to see
      Auntie? There we could put him through his paces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but Nechludoff will not go there,&rdquo; objected Woloda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O unbearable, insupportable man of quiet habits that you are!&rdquo; cried
      Dubkoff, turning to Dimitri. &ldquo;Yet come with us, and you shall see what an
      excellent lady my dear Auntie is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will neither go myself nor let him go,&rdquo; replied Dimitri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let whom go? The DIPLOMAT? Why, you yourself saw how he brightened up at
      the very mention of Auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so much that I WILL NOT LET HIM go,&rdquo; continued Dimitri, rising
      and beginning to pace the room without looking at me, &ldquo;as that I neither
      wish him nor advise him to go. He is not a child now, and if he must go he
      can go alone&mdash;without you. Surely you are ashamed of this, Dubkoff?&mdash;ashamed
      of always wanting others to do all the wrong things that you yourself do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is there so very wrong in my inviting you all to come and take a
      cup of tea with my Aunt?&rdquo; said Dubkoff, with a wink at Woloda. &ldquo;If you
      don&rsquo;t like us going, it is your affair; yet we are going all the same. Are
      you coming, Woloda?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; assented Woloda. &ldquo;We can go there, and then return to my rooms
      and continue our piquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to go with them or not?&rdquo; said Dimitri, approaching me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, at the same time making room for him to sit down beside
      me on the divan. &ldquo;I did not wish to go in any case, and since you advise
      me not to, nothing on earth will make me go now. Yet,&rdquo; I added a moment
      later, &ldquo;I cannot honestly say that I have NO desire to go. All I say is
      that I am glad I am not going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Live your own life, and do not dance to any
      one&rsquo;s piping. That is the better way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This little tiff not only failed to mar our hilarity, but even increased
      it. Dimitri suddenly reverted to the kindly mood which I loved best&mdash;so
      great (as I afterwards remarked on more than one occasion) was the
      influence which the consciousness of having done a good deed exercised
      upon him. At the present moment the source of his satisfaction was the
      fact that he had stopped my expedition to &ldquo;Auntie&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He grew
      extraordinarily gay, called for another bottle of champagne (which was
      against his rules), invited some one who was a perfect stranger into our
      room, plied him with wine, sang &ldquo;Gaudeamus igitur,&rdquo; requested every one to
      join him in the chorus, and proposed that we should and rink at the
      Sokolniki. [Mews.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us enjoy ourselves to-night,&rdquo; he said with a laugh. &ldquo;It is in honour
      of his matriculation that you now see me getting drunk for the first time
      in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet somehow this merriment sat ill upon him. He was like some good-natured
      father or tutor who is pleased with his young charges, and lets himself go
      for their amusement, yet at the same time tries to show them that one can
      enjoy oneself decently and in an honourable manner. However, his
      unexpected gaiety had an infectious influence upon myself and my
      companions, and the more so because each of us had now drunk about half a
      bottle of champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this pleasing frame of mind that I went out into the main salon
      to smoke a cigarette which Dubkoff had given me. In rising I noticed that
      my head seemed to swim a little, and that my legs and arms retained their
      natural positions only when I bent my thoughts determinedly upon them. At
      other moments my legs would deviate from the straight line, and my arms
      describe strange gestures. I concentrated my whole attention upon the
      members in question, forced my hands first to raise themselves and button
      my tunic, and then to smooth my hair (though they ruffled my locks in
      doing so), and lastly commanded my legs to march me to the door&mdash;a
      function which they duly performed, though at one time with too much
      reluctance, and at another with too much ABANDON (the left leg, in
      particular, coming to a halt every moment on tiptoe). Some one called out
      to me, &ldquo;Where are you going to? They will bring you a cigar-light
      directly,&rdquo; but I guessed the voice to be Woloda&rsquo;s, and, feeling satisfied,
      somehow, that I had succeeded in divining the fact, merely smiled airily
      in reply, and continued on my way.

    <h2>
      XVI. THE QUARREL
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the main salon I perceived sitting at a small table a short, squat
      gentleman of the professional type. He had a red moustache, and was
      engaged in eating something or another, while by his side sat a tall,
      clean-shaven individual with whom he was carrying on a conversation in
      French. Somehow the aspect of these two persons displeased me; yet I
      decided, for all that, to light my cigarette at the candelabrum which was
      standing before them. Looking from side to side, to avoid meeting their
      gaze, I approached the table, and applied my cigarette to the flame. When
      it was fairly alight, I involuntarily threw a glance at the gentleman who
      was eating, and found his grey eyes fixed upon me with an expression of
      intense displeasure. Just as I was turning away his red moustache moved a
      little, and he said in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like people to smoke when I am dining, my good sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I murmured something inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not like it at all,&rdquo; he went on sternly, and with a glance at
      his clean-shaven companion, as though inviting him to admire the way in
      which he was about to deal with me. &ldquo;I do not like it, my good sir, nor do
      I like people who have the impudence to puff their smoke up one&rsquo;s very
      nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time I had gathered that it was myself he was scolding, and at
      first felt as though I had been altogether in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean to inconvenience you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you did not suppose you were being impertinent, at least I did!
      You are a cad, young sir!&rdquo; he shouted in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what right have you to shout at me like that?&rdquo; I exclaimed, feeling
      that it was now HE that was insulting ME, and growing angry accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This much right,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that I never allow myself to be overlooked
      by any one, and that I always teach young fellows like yourself their
      manners. What is your name, young sir, and where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this I felt so hurt that my teeth chattered, and I felt as though I
      were choking. Yet all the while I was conscious of being in the wrong, and
      so, instead of offering any further rudeness to the offended one, humbly
      told him my name and address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And MY name, young sir,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;is Kolpikoff, and I will trouble
      you to be more polite to me in future.&mdash;However, You will hear from
      me again&rdquo; (&ldquo;vous aurez de mes nouvelles&rdquo;&mdash;the conversation had been
      carried on wholly in French), was his concluding remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this I replied, &ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; with an infusion of as much
      hauteur as I could muster into my tone. Then, turning on my heel, I
      returned with my cigarette&mdash;which had meanwhile gone out&mdash;to our
      own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing, either to my brother or my friends, about what had
      happened (and the more so because they were at that moment engaged in a
      dispute of their own), but sat down in a corner to think over the strange
      affair. The words, &ldquo;You are a cad, young sir,&rdquo; vexed me more and more the
      longer that they sounded in my ears. My tipsiness was gone now, and, in
      considering my conduct during the dispute, the uncomfortable thought came
      over me that I had behaved like a coward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet what right had he to attack me?&rdquo; I reflected. &ldquo;Why did he not simply
      intimate to me that I was annoying him? After all, it may have been he
      that was in the wrong. Why, too, when he called me a young cad, did I not
      say to him, &lsquo;A cad, my good sir, is one who takes offence&rsquo;? Or why did I
      not simply tell him to hold his tongue? That would have been the better
      course. Or why did I not challenge him to a duel? No, I did none of those
      things, but swallowed his insults like a wretched coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the words, &ldquo;You are a cad, young sir,&rdquo; kept sounding in my ears with
      maddening iteration. &ldquo;I cannot leave things as they are,&rdquo; I at length
      decided as I rose to my feet with the fixed intention of returning to the
      gentleman and saying something outrageous to him&mdash;perhaps, also, of
      breaking the candelabrum over his head if occasion offered. Yet, though I
      considered the advisability of this last measure with some pleasure, it
      was not without a good deal of trepidation that I re-entered the main
      salon. As luck would have it, M. Kolpikoff was no longer there, but only a
      waiter engaged in clearing the table. For a moment I felt like telling the
      waiter the whole story, and explaining to him my innocence in the matter,
      but for some reason or another I thought better of it, and once more
      returned, in the same hazy condition of mind, to our own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of our DIPLOMAT?&rdquo; Dubkoff was just saying. &ldquo;Upon him now
      hang the fortunes of Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, leave me alone,&rdquo; I said, turning moodily away. Then, as I paced the
      room, something made me begin to think that Dubkoff was not altogether a
      good fellow. &ldquo;There is nothing very much to admire in his eternal jokes
      and his nickname of &lsquo;DIPLOMAT,&rsquo;&rdquo; I reflected. &ldquo;All he thinks about is to
      win money from Woloda and to go and see his &lsquo;Auntie.&rsquo; There is nothing
      very nice in all that. Besides, everything he says has a touch of
      blackguardism in it, and he is forever trying to make people laugh. In my
      opinion he is simply stupid when he is not absolutely a brute.&rdquo; I spent
      about five minutes in these reflections, and felt my enmity towards
      Dubkoff continually increasing. For his part, he took no notice of me, and
      that angered me the more. I actually felt vexed with Woloda and Dimitri
      because they went on talking to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what, gentlemen: the DIPLOMAT ought to be christened,&rdquo; said
      Dubkoff suddenly, with a glance and a smile which seemed to me derisive,
      and even treacherous. &ldquo;Yet, O Lord, what a poor specimen he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You yourself ought to be christened, and you yourself are a sorry
      specimen!&rdquo; I retorted with an evil smile, and actually forgetting to
      address him as &ldquo;thou.&rdquo; [In Russian as in French, the second person
      singular is the form of speech used between intimate friends.]
    </p>
    <p>
      This reply evidently surprised Dubkoff, but he turned away
      good-humouredly, and went on talking to Woloda and Dimitri. I tried to
      edge myself into the conversation, but, since I felt that I could not keep
      it up, I soon returned to my corner, and remained there until we left.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bill had been paid and wraps were being put on, Dubkoff turned to
      Dimitri and said: &ldquo;Whither are Orestes and Pedalion going now? Home, I
      suppose, to talk about love. Well, let US go and see my dear Auntie. That
      will be far more entertaining than your sour company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you speak like that, and laugh at us?&rdquo; I burst out as I
      approached him with clenched fists. &ldquo;How dare you laugh at feelings which
      you do not understand? I will not have you do it! Hold your tongue!&rdquo; At
      this point I had to hold my own, for I did not know what to say next, and
      was, moreover, out of breath with excitement. At first Dubkoff was taken
      aback, but presently he tried to laugh it off, and to take it as a joke.
      Finally I was surprised to see him look crestfallen, and lower his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I NEVER laugh at you or your feelings. It is merely my way of speaking,&rdquo;
       he said evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; I cried; yet the next moment I felt ashamed of myself and sorry
      for him, since his flushed, downcast face had in it no other expression
      than one of genuine pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; said Woloda and Dimitri simultaneously. &ldquo;No
      one was trying to insult you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he DID try to insult me!&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an extraordinary fellow your brother is!&rdquo; said Dubkoff to Woloda. At
      that moment he was passing out of the door, and could not have heard what
      I said. Possibly I should have flung myself after him and offered him
      further insult, had it not been that just at that moment the waiter who
      had witnessed my encounter with Kolpikoff handed me my greatcoat, and I at
      once quietened down&mdash;merely making such a pretence of having had a
      difference with Dimitri as was necessary to make my sudden appeasement
      appear nothing extraordinary. Next day, when I met Dubkoff at Woloda&rsquo;s,
      the quarrel was not raked up, yet he and I still addressed each other as
      &ldquo;you,&rdquo; and found it harder than ever to look one another in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remembrance of my scene with Kolpikoff&mdash;who, by the way, never
      sent me &ldquo;de ses nouvelles,&rdquo; either the following day or any day afterwards&mdash;remained
      for years a keen and unpleasant memory. Even so much as five years after
      it had happened I would begin fidgeting and muttering to myself whenever I
      remembered the unavenged insult, and was fain to comfort myself with the
      satisfaction of recollecting the sort of young fellow I had shown myself
      to be in my subsequent affair with Dubkoff. In fact, it was only later
      still that I began to regard the matter in another light, and both to
      recall with comic appreciation my passage of arms with Kolpikoff, and to
      regret the undeserved affront which I had offered my good friend Dubkoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at a later hour on the evening of the dinner, I told Dimitri of my
      affair with Kolpikoff, whose exterior I described in detail, he was
      astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the very man!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that this precious
      Kolpikoff is a known scamp and sharper, as well as, above all things, a
      coward, and that he was expelled from his regiment by his brother officers
      because, having had his face slapped, he would not fight? But how came you
      to let him get away?&rdquo; he added, with a kindly smile and glance. &ldquo;Surely he
      could not have said more to you than he did when he called you a cad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I admitted with a blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was not right, but there is no great harm done,&rdquo; said Dimitri
      consolingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long afterwards, when thinking the matter over at leisure, I suddenly came
      to the conclusion that it was quite possible that Kolpikoff took the
      opportunity of vicariously wiping off upon me the slap in the face which
      he had once received, just as I myself took the opportunity of vicariously
      wiping off upon the innocent Dubkoff the epithet &ldquo;cad&rdquo; which Kolpikoff had
      just applied to me.

    <h2>
      XVII. I GET READY TO PAY SOME CALLS
    </h2>
    <p>
      On awaking next morning my first thoughts were of the affair with
      Kolpikoff. Once again I muttered to myself and stamped about the room, but
      there was no help for it. To-day was the last day that I was to spend in
      Moscow, and it was to be spent, by Papa&rsquo;s orders, in my paying a round of
      calls which he had written out for me on a piece of paper&mdash;his first
      solicitude on our account being not so much for our morals or our
      education as for our due observance of the convenances. On the piece of
      paper was written in his swift, broken hand-writing: &ldquo;(1) Prince Ivan
      Ivanovitch WITHOUT FAIL; (2) the Iwins WITHOUT FAIL; (3) Prince Michael;
      (4) the Princess Nechludoff and Madame Valakhina if you wish.&rdquo; Of course I
      was also to call upon my guardian, upon the rector, and upon the
      professors.
    </p>
    <p>
      These last-mentioned calls, however, Dimitri advised me not to pay: saying
      that it was not only unnecessary to do so, but not the thing. However,
      there were the other visits to be got through. It was the first two on the
      list&mdash;those marked as to be paid &ldquo;WITHOUT FAIL&rdquo;&mdash;that most
      alarmed me. Prince Ivan Ivanovitch was a commander-in-chief, as well as
      old, wealthy, and a bachelor. Consequently, I foresaw that vis-a-vis
      conversation between him and myself&mdash;myself a sixteen-year-old
      student!&mdash;was not likely to be interesting. As for the Iwins, they
      too were rich&mdash;the father being a departmental official of high rank
      who had only on one occasion called at our house during my grandmother&rsquo;s
      time. Since her death, I had remarked that the younger Iwin had fought shy
      of us, and seemed to give himself airs. The elder of the pair, I had
      heard, had now finished his course in jurisprudence, and gone to hold a
      post in St. Petersburg, while his brother Sergius (the former object of my
      worship) was also in St. Petersburg, as a great fat cadet in the Corps of
      Pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was a young man, not only did I dislike intercourse with people who
      thought themselves above me, but such intercourse was, for me, an
      unbearable torture, owing partly to my constant dread of being snubbed,
      and partly to my straining every faculty of my intellect to prove to such
      people my independence. Yet, even if I failed to fulfil the latter part of
      my father&rsquo;s instructions, I felt that I must carry out the former. I paced
      my room and eyed my clothes ready disposed on chairs&mdash;the tunic, the
      sword, and the cap. Just as I was about to set forth, old Grap called to
      congratulate me, bringing with him Ilinka. Grap pere was a Russianised
      German and an intolerably effusive, sycophantic old man who was more often
      than not tipsy. As a rule, he visited us only when he wanted to ask for
      something, and although Papa sometimes entertained him in his study, old
      Grap never came to dinner with us. With his subserviency and begging
      propensities went such a faculty of good-humour and a power of making
      himself at home that every one looked upon his attachment to us as a great
      honour. For my part, however, I never liked him, and felt ashamed when he
      was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was much put out by the arrival of these visitors, and made no effort to
      conceal the fact. Upon Ilinka I had been so used to look down, and he so
      used to recognise my right to do so, that it displeased me to think that
      he was now as much a matriculated student as myself. In some way he
      appeared to me to have made a POINT of attaining that equality. I greeted
      the pair coldly, and, without offering them any refreshment (since it went
      against the grain to do so, and I thought they could ask for anything, if
      they wanted it, without my first inviting them to state their
      requirements), gave orders for the drozhki to be got ready. Ilinka was a
      good-natured, extremely moral, and far from stupid young fellow; yet, for
      all that, what people call a person of moods. That is to say, for no
      apparent reason he was for ever in some PRONOUNCED frame of mind&mdash;now
      lachrymose, now frivolous, now touchy on the very smallest point. At the
      present moment he appeared to be in the last-named mood. He kept looking
      from his father to myself without speaking, except when directly
      addressed, at which times he smiled the self-deprecatory, forced smile
      under which he was accustomed to conceal his feelings, and more especially
      that feeling of shame for his father which he must have experienced in our
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Nicolas Petrovitch,&rdquo; the old man said to me, following me everywhere
      about the room as I went through the operation of dressing, while all the
      while his fat fingers kept turning over and over a silver snuff-box with
      which my grandmother had once presented me, &ldquo;as soon as ever I heard from
      my son that you had passed your examinations so well (though of course
      your abilities are well-known to everyone), I at once came to congratulate
      you, my dear boy. Why, I have carried you on my shoulders before now, and
      God knows that I love you as though you were my own son. My Ilinka too has
      always been fond of you, and feels quite at home with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the said Ilinka remained sitting silently by the window,
      apparently absorbed in contemplation of my three-cornered cap, and every
      now and then angrily muttering something in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I also wanted to ask you, Nicolas Petrovitch.&rdquo; His father went on,
      &ldquo;whether my son did well in the examinations? He tells me that he is going
      to be in the same faculty as yourself, and that therefore you will be able
      to keep an eye on him, and advise him, and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I suppose he passed well,&rdquo; I replied, with a glance at Ilinka,
      who, conscious of my gaze, reddened violently and ceased to move his lips
      about. &ldquo;And might he spend the day with you?&rdquo; was the father&rsquo;s next
      request, which he made with a deprecatory smile, as though he stood in
      actual awe of me, yet always keeping so close to me, wherever I moved,
      that the fumes of the drink and tobacco in which he had been indulging
      were constantly perceptible to my nostrils. I felt greatly vexed at his
      placing me in such a false position towards his son, as well as at his
      distracting my attention from what was, to me, a highly important
      operation&mdash;namely, the operation of dressing; while, over and above
      all, I was annoyed by the smell of liquor with which he followed me about.
      Accordingly, I said very coldly that I could not have the pleasure of
      Ilinka&rsquo;s company that day, since I should be out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I suppose you are going to see your sister?&rdquo; put in Ilinka with a
      smile, but without looking at me. &ldquo;Well, I too have business to attend
      to.&rdquo; At this I felt even more put out, as well as pricked with
      compunction; so, to soften my refusal a little, I hastened to say that the
      reason why I should not be at home that day was that I had to call upon
      the PRINCE Ivan Ivanovitch, the PRINCESS Kornakoff, and the Monsieur Iwin
      who held such an influential post, as well as, probably, to dine with the
      PRINCESS Nechludoff (for I thought that, on learning what important folk I
      was in the habit of mixing with, the Graps would no longer think it worth
      while to pretend to me). However, just as they were leaving, I invited
      Ilinka to come and see me another day; but he only murmured something
      unintelligible, and it was plain that he meant never to set foot in the
      house again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had departed, I set off on my round of calls. Woloda, whom I had
      asked that morning to come with me, in order that I might not feel quite
      so shy as when altogether alone, had declined on the ground that for two
      brothers to be seen driving in one drozhki would appear so horribly
      &ldquo;proper.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XVIII. THE VALAKHIN FAMILY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Accordingly I set off alone. My first call on the route lay at the
      Valakhin mansion. It was now three years since I had seen Sonetchka, and
      my love for her had long become a thing of the past, yet there still
      lingered in my heart a sort of clear, touching recollection of our bygone
      childish affection. At intervals, also, during those three years, I had
      found myself recalling her memory with such force and vividness that I had
      actually shed tears, and imagined myself to be in love with her again, but
      those occasions had not lasted more than a few minutes at a time, and had
      been long in recurring.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that Sonetchka and her mother had been abroad&mdash;that, in fact,
      they had been so for the last two years. Also, I had heard that they had
      been in a carriage accident, and that Sonetchka&rsquo;s face had been so badly
      cut with the broken glass that her beauty was marred. As I drove to their
      house, I kept recalling the old Sonetchka to my mind, and wondering what
      she would look like when I met her. Somehow I imagined that, after her two
      years&rsquo; sojourn abroad, she would look very tall, with a beautiful waist,
      and, though sedate and imposing, extremely attractive. Somehow, also, my
      imagination refused to picture her with her face disfigured with scars,
      but, on the contrary, since I had read somewhere of a lover who remained
      true to his adored one in spite of her disfigurement with smallpox, strove
      to imagine that I was in love with Sonetchka, for the purpose of priding
      myself on holding to my troth in spite of her scars&mdash;Yet, as a matter
      of fact, I was not really in love with her during that drive, but having
      once stirred up in myself old MEMORIES of love, felt PREPARED to fall into
      that condition, and the more so because, of late, my conscience had often
      been pricking me for having discarded so many of my old flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Valakhins lived in a neat little wooden mansion approached by a
      courtyard. I gained admittance by ringing a bell (then a rarity in
      Moscow), and was received by a mincing, smartly-attired page. He either
      could not or made no attempt to inform me whether there was any one at
      home, but, leaving me alone in the dark hall, ran off down a still darker
      corridor. For a long time I waited in solitude in this gloomy place, out
      of which, in addition to the front door and the corridor, there only
      opened a door which at the moment was closed. Rather surprised at the
      dismal appearance of the house, I came to the conclusion that the reason
      was that its inmates were still abroad. After five minutes, however, the
      door leading into the salon was opened by the page boy, who then conducted
      me into a neat, but not richly furnished, drawing-room, where presently I
      was joined by Sonetchka.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now seventeen years old, and very small and thin, as well as of an
      unhealthy pallor of face. No scars at all were visible, however, and the
      beautiful, prominent eyes and bright, cheerful smile were the same as I
      had known and loved in my childhood. I had not expected her to look at all
      like this, and therefore could not at once lavish upon her the sentiment
      which I had been preparing on the way. She gave me her hand in the English
      fashion (which was then as much a novelty as a door-bell), and, bestowing
      upon mine a frank squeeze, sat down on the sofa by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how glad I am to see you, my dear Nicolas!&rdquo; she said as she looked me
      in the face with an expression of pleasure so sincere that in the words
      &ldquo;my dear Nicolas&rdquo; I caught the purely friendly rather than the patronising
      note. To my surprise she seemed to me simpler, kinder, and more sisterly
      after her foreign tour than she had been before it. True, I could now see
      that she had two small scars between her nose and temples, but her
      wonderful eyes and smile fitted in exactly with my recollections, and
      shone as of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how greatly you have changed!&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You are quite grown-up
      now. And I-I-well, what do you think of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never have known you,&rdquo; I replied, despite the fact that at the
      moment I was thinking that I should have known her anywhere and always.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Am I grown so ugly?&rdquo; she inquired with a movement of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, decidedly not!&rdquo; I hastened to reply. &ldquo;But you have grown taller
      and older. As for being uglier, why, you are even&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; never mind. Do you remember our dances and games, and St.
      Jerome, and Madame Dorat?&rdquo; (As a matter of fact, I could not recollect any
      Madame Dorat, but saw that Sonetchka was being led away by the joy of her
      childish recollections, and mixing them up a little). &ldquo;Ah! what a lovely
      time it was!&rdquo; she went on&mdash;and once more there shone before me the
      same eyes and smile as I had always carried in my memory. While she had
      been speaking, I had been thinking over my position at the present moment,
      and had come to the conclusion that I was in love with her. The instant,
      however, that I arrived at that result my careless, happy mood vanished, a
      mist seemed to arise before me which concealed even her eyes and smile,
      and, blushing hotly, I became tongue-tied and ill-at-ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But times are different now,&rdquo; she went on with a sigh and a little
      lifting of her eyebrows. &ldquo;Everything seems worse than it used to be, and
      ourselves too. Is it not so, Nicolas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could return her no answer, but sat silently looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are those Iwins and Kornakoffs now? Do you remember them?&rdquo; she
      continued, looking, I think, with some curiosity at my blushing, downcast
      countenance. &ldquo;What splendid times we used to have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still I could not answer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment, I was relieved from this awkward position by the entry of
      old Madame Valakhin into the room. Rising, I bowed, and straightway
      recovered my faculty of speech. On the other hand, an extraordinary change
      now took place in Sonetchka. All her gaiety and bonhomie disappeared, her
      smile became quite a different one, and, except for the point of her
      shortness of stature, she became just the lady from abroad whom I had
      expected to find in her. Yet for this change there was no apparent reason,
      since her mother smiled every whit as pleasantly, and expressed in her
      every movement just the same benignity, as of old. Seating herself in her
      arm-chair, the old lady signed to me to come and sit beside her; after
      which she said something to her daughter in English, and Sonetchka left
      the room&mdash;a fact which still further helped to relieve me. Madame
      then inquired after my father and brother, and passed on to speak of her
      great bereavement&mdash;the loss of her husband. Presently, however, she
      seemed to become sensible of the fact that I was not helping much in the
      conversation, for she gave me a look as much as to say: &ldquo;If, now, my dear
      boy, you were to get up, to take your leave, and to depart, it would be
      well.&rdquo; But a curious circumstance had overtaken me. While she had been
      speaking of her bereavement, I had recalled to myself, not only the fact
      that I was in love, but the probability that the mother knew of it:
      whereupon such a fit of bashfulness had come upon me that I felt powerless
      to put any member of my body to its legitimate use. I knew that if I were
      to rise and walk I should have to think where to plant each foot, what to
      do with my head, what with my hands, and so on. In a word, I foresaw that
      I should be very much as I had been on the night when I partook too freely
      of champagne, and therefore, since I felt uncertain of being able to
      manage myself if I DID rise, I ended by feeling UNABLE to rise. Meanwhile,
      I should say, Sonetchka had returned to the room with her work, and seated
      herself in a far corner&mdash;a corner whence, as I was nevertheless
      sensible, she could observe me. Madame must have felt some surprise as she
      gazed at my crimson face and noted my complete immobility, but I decided
      that it was better to continue sitting in that absurd position than to
      risk something unpleasant by getting up and walking. Thus I sat on and on,
      in the hope that some unforeseen chance would deliver me from my
      predicament. That unforeseen chance at length presented itself in the
      person of an unforeseen young man, who entered the room with an air of
      being one of the household, and bowed to me politely as he did so:
      whereupon Madame rose, excused herself to me for having to speak with her
      &ldquo;homme d&rsquo;affaires,&rdquo; and finally gave me a glance which said: &ldquo;Well, if you
      DO mean to go on sitting there for ever, at least I can&rsquo;t drive you away.&rdquo;
       Accordingly, with a great effort I also rose, but, finding it impossible
      to do any leave-taking, moved away towards the door, followed by the
      pitying glances of mother and daughter. All at once I stumbled over a
      chair, although it was lying quite out of my route: the reason for my
      stumbling being that my whole attention was centred upon not tripping over
      the carpet. Driving through the fresh air, however&mdash;where at first I
      muttered and fidgeted about so much that Kuzma, my coachman, asked me what
      was the matter&mdash;I soon found this feeling pass away, and began to
      meditate quietly concerning my love for Sonetchka and her relations with
      her mother, which had appeared to me rather strange. When, afterwards, I
      told my father that mother and daughter had not seemed on the best of
      terms with one another, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame leads the poor girl an awful life with her meanness. Yet,&rdquo;
       added my father with a greater display of feeling than a man might
      naturally conceive for a mere relative, &ldquo;she used to be such an original,
      dear, charming woman! I cannot think what has made her change so much. By
      the way, you didn&rsquo;t notice a secretary fellow about, did you? Fancy a
      Russian lady having an affaire with a secretary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw him,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was he at least good-looking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is extraordinary!&rdquo; concluded Papa, with a cough and an irritable hoist
      of his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am in love!&rdquo; was my secret thought to myself as I drove along in
      my drozhki.

    <h2>
      XIX. THE KORNAKOFFS
    </h2>
    <p>
      MY second call on the route lay at the Kornakoffs&rsquo;, who lived on the first
      floor of a large mansion facing the Arbat. The staircase of the building
      looked extremely neat and orderly, yet in no way luxurious&mdash;being
      lined only with drugget pinned down with highly-polished brass rods.
      Nowhere were there any flowers or mirrors to be seen. The salon, too, with
      its polished floor, which I traversed on my way to the drawing-room, was
      decorated in the same cold, severe, unostentatious style. Everything in it
      looked bright and solid, but not new, and pictures, flower-stands, and
      articles of bric-a-brac were wholly absent. In the drawing-room I found
      some of the young princesses seated, but seated with the sort of correct,
      &ldquo;company&rdquo; air about them which gave one the impression that they sat like
      that only when guests were expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma will be here presently,&rdquo; the eldest of them said to me as she
      seated herself by my side. For the next quarter of an hour, this young
      lady entertained me with such an easy flow of small-talk that the
      conversation never flagged a moment. Yet somehow she made so patent the
      fact that she was just entertaining me that I felt not altogether pleased.
      Amongst other things, she told me that their brother Stephen (whom they
      called Etienne, and who had been two years at the College of Cadets) had
      now received his commission. Whenever she spoke of him, and more
      particularly when she told me that he had flouted his mother&rsquo;s wishes by
      entering the Hussars, she assumed a nervous air, and immediately her
      sisters, sitting there in silence, also assumed a nervous air. When,
      again, she spoke of my grandmother&rsquo;s death, she assumed a MOURNFUL air,
      and immediately the others all did the same. Finally, when she recalled
      how I had once struck St. Jerome and been expelled from the room, she
      laughed and showed her bad teeth, and immediately all the other princesses
      laughed and showed their bad teeth too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, the Princess-Mother herself entered&mdash;a little dried-up woman,
      with a wandering glance and a habit of always looking at somebody else
      when she was addressing one. Taking my hand, she raised her own to my lips
      for me to kiss it&mdash;which otherwise, not supposing it to be necessary,
      I should not have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pleased I am to see you!&rdquo; she said with her usual clearness of
      articulation as she gazed at her daughters. &ldquo;And how like your mother you
      look! Does he not, Lise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lise assented, though I knew for a fact that I did not resemble my mother
      in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a grown-up you have become! My Etienne, you will remember, is
      your second cousin. No, not second cousin&mdash;what is it, Lise? My
      mother was Barbara Dimitrievna, daughter of Dimitri Nicolaevitch, and your
      grandmother was Natalia Nicolaevna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is our THIRD cousin, Mamma,&rdquo; said the eldest girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how you always confuse me!&rdquo; was her mother&rsquo;s angry reply. &ldquo;Not third
      cousin, but COUSIN GERMAN&mdash;that is your relationship to Etienne. He
      is an officer now. Did you know it? It is not well that he should have his
      own way too much. You young men need keeping in hand, or&mdash;! Well, you
      are not vexed because your old aunt tells you the plain truth? I always
      kept Etienne strictly in hand, for I found it necessary to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is how our relationship stands,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Prince Ivan
      Ivanovitch is my uncle, and your late mother&rsquo;s uncle also. Consequently I
      must have been your mother&rsquo;s first cousin&mdash;no, second cousin. Yes,
      that is it. Tell me, have you been to call on Prince Ivan yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said no, but that I was just going to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, is it possible?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why, you ought to have paid him the
      first call of all! Surely you know that he stands to you in the position
      of a father? He has no children of his own, and his only heirs are
      yourself and my children. You ought to pay him all possible deference,
      both because of his age, and because of his position in the world, and
      because of everything else. I know that you young fellows of the present
      day think nothing of relationships and are not fond of old men, yet do you
      listen to me, your old aunt, for I am fond of you, and was fond of your
      mother, and had a great&mdash;a very great-liking and respect for your
      grandmother. You must not fail to call upon him on any account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said that I would certainly go, and since my present call seemed to me
      to have lasted long enough, I rose, and was about to depart, but she
      restrained me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, wait a minute,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Where is your father, Lise? Go and tell
      him to come here. He will be so glad to see you,&rdquo; she added, turning to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later Prince Michael entered. He was a short, thick-set
      gentleman, very slovenly dressed and ill-shaven, yet wearing such an air
      of indifference that he looked almost a fool. He was not in the least glad
      to see me&mdash;at all events he did not intimate that he was; but the
      Princess (who appeared to stand in considerable awe of him) hastened to
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not Woldemar here&rdquo; (she seemed to have forgotten my name) &ldquo;exactly
      like his mother?&rdquo; and she gave her husband a glance which forced him to
      guess what she wanted. Accordingly he approached me with his usual
      passionless, half-discontented expression, and held out to me an unshaven
      cheek to kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you are not dressed yet, though you have to go out soon!&rdquo; was the
      Princess&rsquo;s next remark to him in the angry tone which she habitually
      employed in conversation with her domestics. &ldquo;It will only mean your
      offending some one again, and trying to set people against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a moment, in a moment, mother,&rdquo; said Prince Michael, and departed. I
      also made my bows and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time I had heard of our being related to Prince Ivan
      Ivanovitch, and the news struck me unpleasantly.

    <h2>
      XX. THE IWINS
    </h2>
    <p>
      As for the prospect of my call upon the Prince, it seemed even more
      unpleasant. However, the order of my route took me first to the Iwins, who
      lived in a large and splendid mansion in Tverskaia Street. It was not
      without some nervousness that I entered the great portico where a Swiss
      major-domo stood armed with his staff of office.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my inquiry as to whether any one was at home he replied: &ldquo;Whom do you
      wish to see, sir? The General&rsquo;s son is within.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the General himself?&rdquo; I asked with forced assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must report to him your business first. What may it be, sir?&rdquo; said the
      major-domo as he rang a bell. Immediately the gaitered legs of a footman
      showed themselves on the staircase above; whereupon I was seized with such
      a fit of nervousness that I hastily bid the lacquey say nothing about my
      presence to the General, since I would first see his son. By the time I
      had reached the top of the long staircase, I seemed to have grown
      extremely small (metaphorically, I mean, not actually), and had very much
      the same feeling within me as had possessed my soul when my drozhki drew
      up to the great portico, namely, a feeling as though drozhki, horse, and
      coachman had all of them grown extremely small too. I found the General&rsquo;s
      son lying asleep on a sofa, with an open book before him. His tutor,
      Monsieur Frost, under whose care he still pursued his studies at home, had
      entered behind me with a sort of boyish tread, and now awoke his pupil.
      Iwin evinced no particular pleasure at seeing me, while I also seemed to
      notice that, while talking to me, he kept looking at my eyebrows. Although
      he was perfectly polite, I conceived that he was &ldquo;entertaining&rdquo; me much as
      the Princess Valakhin had done, and that he not only felt no particular
      liking for me, but even that he considered my acquaintance in no way
      necessary to one who possessed his own circle of friends. All this arose
      out of the idea that he was regarding my eyebrows. In short, his bearing
      towards me appeared to be (as I recognised with an awkward sensation) very
      much the same as my own towards Ilinka Grap. I began to feel irritated,
      and to interpret every fleeting glance which he cast at Monsieur Frost as
      a mute inquiry: &ldquo;Why has this fellow come to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some conversation he remarked that his father and mother were at
      home. Would I not like to visit them too?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First I will go and dress myself,&rdquo; he added as he departed to another
      room, notwithstanding that he had seemed to be perfectly well dressed (in
      a new frockcoat and white waistcoat) in the present one. A few minutes
      later he reappeared in his University uniform, buttoned up to the chin,
      and we went downstairs together. The reception rooms through which we
      passed were lofty and of great size, and seemed to be richly furnished
      with marble and gilt ornaments, chintz-covered settees, and a number of
      mirrors. Presently Madame Iwin met us, and we went into a little room
      behind the drawing-room, where, welcoming me in very friendly fashion, she
      seated herself by my side, and began to inquire after my relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closer acquaintance with Madame (whom I had seen only twice before, and
      that but for a moment on each occasion) impressed me favourably. She was
      tall, thin, and very pale, and looked as though she suffered from chronic
      depression and fatigue. Yet, though her smile was a sad one, it was very
      kind, and her large, mournful eyes, with a slight cast in their vision,
      added to the pathos and attractiveness of her expression. Her attitude,
      while not precisely that of a hunchback, made her whole form droop, while
      her every movement expressed languor. Likewise, though her speech was
      deliberate, the timbre of her voice, and the manner in which she lisped
      her r&rsquo;s and l&rsquo;s, were very pleasing to the ear. Finally, she did not
      &ldquo;ENTERTAIN&rdquo; me. Unfortunately, the answers which I returned to her
      questions concerning my relations seemed to afford her a painful interest,
      and to remind her of happier days: with the result that when, presently,
      her son left the room, she gazed at me in silence for a moment, and then
      burst into tears. As I sat there in mute bewilderment, I could not
      conceive what I had said to bring this about. At first I felt sorry for
      her as she sat there weeping with downcast eyes. Next I began to think to
      myself: &ldquo;Ought I not to try and comfort her, and how ought that to be
      done?&rdquo; Finally, I began to feel vexed with her for placing me in such an
      awkward position. &ldquo;Surely my appearance is not so moving as all that?&rdquo; I
      reflected. &ldquo;Or is she merely acting like this to see what I shall do under
      the circumstances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it would not do for me to go,&rdquo; I continued to myself, &ldquo;for that would
      look too much as though I were fleeing to escape her tears.&rdquo; Accordingly I
      began fidgeting about on my seat, in order to remind her of my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how foolish of me!&rdquo; at length she said, as she gazed at me for a
      moment and tried to smile. &ldquo;There are days when one weeps for no reason
      whatever.&rdquo; She felt about for her handkerchief, and then burst out weeping
      more violently than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! How silly of me to be for ever crying like this! Yet I was so
      fond of your mother! We were such friends! We-we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point she found her handkerchief, and, burying her face in it,
      went on crying. Once more I found myself in the same protracted dilemma.
      Though vexed, I felt sorry for her, since her tears appeared to be genuine&mdash;even
      though I also had an idea that it was not so much for my mother that she
      was weeping as for the fact that she was unhappy, and had known happier
      days. How it would all have ended I do not know, had not her son
      reappeared and said that his father desired to see her. Thereupon she
      rose, and was just about to leave the room, when the General himself
      entered. He was a small, grizzled, thick-set man, with bushy black
      eyebrows, a grey, close-cropped head, and a very stern, haughty expression
      of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose and bowed to him, but the General (who was wearing three stars on
      his green frockcoat) not only made no response to my salutation, but
      scarcely even looked at me; so that all at once I felt as though I were
      not a human being at all, but only some negligible object such as a settee
      or window; or, if I were a human being, as though I were quite
      indistinguishable from such a negligible object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have not yet written to the Countess, my dear?&rdquo; he said to his
      wife in French, and with an imperturbable, yet determined, expression on
      his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Monsieur Irtenieff,&rdquo; Madame said to me, in her turn, as she
      made a proud gesture with her head and looked at my eyebrows just as her
      son had done. I bowed to her, and again to her husband, but my second
      salutation made no more impression upon him than if a window had just been
      opened or closed. Nevertheless the younger Iwin accompanied me to the
      door, and on the way told me that he was to go to St. Petersburg
      University, since his father had been appointed to a post in that city
      (and young Iwin named a very high office in the service).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, his Papa may do whatsoever he likes,&rdquo; I muttered to myself as I
      climbed into the drozhki, &ldquo;but at all events I will never set foot in that
      house again. His wife weeps and looks at me as though I were the
      embodiment of woe, while that old pig of a General does not even give me a
      bow. However, I will get even with him some day.&rdquo; How I meant to do that I
      do not know, but my words nevertheless came true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, I frequently found it necessary to remember the advice of my
      father when he said that I must cultivate the acquaintanceship of the
      Iwins, and not expect a man in the position of General Iwin to pay any
      attention to a boy like myself. But I had figured in that position long
      enough.

    <h2>
      XXI. PRINCE IVAN IVANOVITCH
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the last call&mdash;the visit to Nikitskaia Street,&rdquo; I said to
      Kuzma, and we started for Prince Ivan Ivanovitch&rsquo;s mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end, a round of calls usually brings one a certain amount of
      self-assurance: consequently I was approaching the Prince&rsquo;s abode in quite
      a tranquil frame of mind, when suddenly I remembered the Princess
      Kornakoff&rsquo;s words that I was his heir, and at the same moment caught sight
      of two carriages waiting at the portico. Instantly, my former nervousness
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the old major-domo who opened the door to me, and the footman who
      took my coat, and the two male and three female visitors whom I found in
      the drawing-room, and, most of all, Prince Ivan Ivanovitch himself (whom I
      found clad in a &ldquo;company&rdquo; frockcoat and seated on a sofa) seemed to look
      at me as at an HEIR, and so to eye me with ill-will. Yet the Prince was
      very gracious and, after kissing me (that is to say, after pressing his
      cold, dry, flabby lips to my cheek for a second), asked me about my plans
      and pursuits, jested with me, inquired whether I still wrote verses of the
      kind which I used to indite in honour of my grandmother&rsquo;s birthdays, and
      invited me to dine with him that day. Nevertheless, in proportion as he
      grew the kinder, the more did I feel persuaded that his civility was only
      intended to conceal from me the fact that he disliked the idea of my being
      his heir. He had a custom (due to his false teeth, of which his mouth
      possessed a complete set) of raising his upper lip a little as he spoke,
      and producing a slight whistling sound from it; and whenever, on the
      present occasion, he did so it seemed to me that he was saying to himself:
      &ldquo;A boy, a boy&mdash;I know it! And my heir, too&mdash;my heir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we were children, we had been used to calling the Prince &ldquo;dear
      Uncle;&rdquo; but now, in my capacity of heir, I could not bring my tongue to
      the phrase, while to say &ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; as did one of the other
      visitors, seemed derogatory to my self-esteem. Consequently, never once
      during that visit did I call him anything at all. The personage, however,
      who most disturbed me was the old Princess who shared with me the position
      of prospective inheritor, and who lived in the Prince&rsquo;s house. While
      seated beside her at dinner, I felt firmly persuaded that the reason why
      she would not speak to me was that she disliked me for being her co-heir,
      and that the Prince, for his part, paid no attention to our side of the
      table for the reason that the Princess and myself hoped to succeed him,
      and so were alike distasteful in his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot think how I hated it all!&rdquo; I said to Dimitrieff the same
      evening, in a desire to make a parade of disliking the notion of being an
      heir (somehow I thought it the thing to do). &ldquo;You cannot think how I
      loathed the whole two hours that I spent there!&mdash;Yet he is a
      fine-looking old fellow, and was very kind to me,&rdquo; I added&mdash;wishing,
      among other things, to disabuse my friend of any possible idea that my
      loathing had arisen out of the fact that I had felt so small. &ldquo;It is only
      the idea that people may be classing me with the Princess who lives with
      him, and who licks the dust off his boots. He is a wonderful old man, and
      good and considerate to everybody, but it is awful to see how he treats
      the Princess. Money is a detestable thing, and ruins all human relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I think it would be far the best thing for me to have an
      open explanation with the Prince,&rdquo; I went on; &ldquo;to tell him that I respect
      him as a man, but think nothing of being his heir, and that I desire him
      to leave me nothing, since that is the only condition on which I can, in
      future, visit his house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of bursting out laughing when I said this, Dimitri pondered awhile
      in silence, and then answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong. Either you ought to refrain from supposing that people may
      be classing you with this Princess of whom you speak, or, if you DO
      suppose such a thing, you ought to suppose further that people are
      thinking what you yourself know quite well&mdash;namely, that such
      thoughts are so utterly foreign to your nature that you despise them and
      would never make them a basis for action. Suppose, however, that people DO
      suppose you to suppose such a thing&mdash;Well, to sum up,&rdquo; he added,
      feeling that he was getting a little mixed in his pronouncements, &ldquo;you had
      much better not suppose anything of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend was perfectly right, though it was not until long, long
      afterwards that experience of life taught me the evil that comes of
      thinking&mdash;still worse, of saying&mdash;much that seems very fine;
      taught me that there are certain thoughts which should always be kept to
      oneself, since brave words seldom go with brave deeds. I learnt then that
      the mere fact of giving utterance to a good intention often makes it
      difficult, nay, impossible, to carry that good intention into effect. Yet
      how is one to refrain from giving utterance to the brave, self-sufficient
      impulses of youth? Only long afterwards does one remember and regret them,
      even as one incontinently plucks a flower before its blooming, and
      subsequently finds it lying crushed and withered on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next morning I, who had just been telling my friend Dimitri that
      money corrupts all human relations, and had (as we have seen) squandered
      the whole of my cash on pictures and Turkish pipes, accepted a loan of
      twenty roubles which he suggested should pay for my travelling expenses
      into the country, and remained a long while thereafter in his debt!

    <h2>
      XXII. INTIMATE CONVERSATION WITH MY FRIEND
    </h2>
    <p>
      THIS conversation of ours took place in a phaeton on the way to Kuntsevo.
      Dimitri had invited me in the morning to go with him to his mother&rsquo;s, and
      had called for me after luncheon; the idea being that I should spend the
      evening, and perhaps also pass the night, at the country-house where his
      family lived. Only when we had left the city and exchanged its grimy
      streets and the unbearably deafening clatter of its pavements for the open
      vista of fields and the subdued grinding of carriage-wheels on a dusty
      high road (while the sweet spring air and prospect enveloped us on every
      side) did I awake from the new impressions and sensations of freedom into
      which the past two days had plunged me. Dimitri was in his kind and
      sociable mood. That is to say, he was neither frowning nor blinking
      nervously nor straightening his neck in his collar. For my own part, I was
      congratulating myself on those noble sentiments which I have expressed
      above, in the belief that they had led him to overlook my shameful
      encounter with Kolpikoff, and to refrain from despising me for it. Thus we
      talked together on many an intimate subject which even a friend seldom
      mentions to a friend. He told me about his family whose acquaintance I had
      not yet made&mdash;about his mother, his aunt, and his sister, as also
      about her whom Woloda and Dubkoff believed to be his &ldquo;flame,&rdquo; and always
      spoke of as &ldquo;the lady with the chestnut locks.&rdquo; Of his mother he spoke
      with a certain cold and formal commendation, as though to forestall any
      further mention of her; his aunt he extolled enthusiastically, though with
      a touch of condescension in his tone; his sister he scarcely mentioned at
      all, as though averse to doing so in my presence; but on the subject of
      &ldquo;the lady with the chestnut locks&rdquo; (whose real name was Lubov Sergievna,
      and who was a grown-up young lady living on a family footing with the
      Nechludoffs) he discoursed with animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is a wonderful woman,&rdquo; he said with a conscious reddening of the
      face, yet looking me in the eyes with dogged temerity. &ldquo;True, she is no
      longer young, and even rather elderly, as well as by no means
      good-looking; but as for loving a mere featherhead, a mere beauty&mdash;well,
      I never could understand that, for it is such a silly thing to do.&rdquo;
       (Dimitri said this as though he had just discovered a most novel and
      extraordinary truth.) &ldquo;I am certain, too, that such a soul, such a heart
      and principles, as are hers are not to be found elsewhere in the world of
      the present day.&rdquo; (I do not know whence he had derived the habit of saying
      that few good things were discoverable in the world of the present day,
      but at all events he loved to repeat the expression, and it somehow suited
      him.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, I am afraid,&rdquo; he went on quietly, after thus annihilating all such
      men as were foolish enough to admire mere beauty, &ldquo;I am afraid that you
      will not understand or realise her quickly. She is modest, even secretive,
      and by no means fond of exhibiting her beautiful and surprising qualities.
      Now, my mother&mdash;who, as you will see, is a noble, sensible woman&mdash;has
      known Lubov Sergievna, for many years; yet even to this day she does not
      properly understand her. Shall I tell you why I was out of temper last
      evening when you were questioning me? Well, you must know that the day
      before yesterday Lubov asked me to accompany her to Ivan Yakovlevitch&rsquo;s
      (you have heard of him, I suppose? the fellow who seems to be mad, but
      who, in reality, is a very remarkable man). Well, Lubov is extremely
      religious, and understands Ivan Yakovlevitch to the full. She often goes
      to see him, and converses with him, and gives him money for the poor&mdash;money
      which she has earned herself. She is a marvellous woman, as you will see.
      Well, I went with her to Ivan&rsquo;s, and felt very grateful to her for having
      afforded me the opportunity of exchanging a word with so remarkable a man;
      but my mother could not understand our action at all, and discerned in it
      only superstition. Consequently, last night she and I quarrelled for the
      first time in our lives. A very bitter one it was, too,&rdquo; he concluded,
      with a convulsive shrug of his shoulders, as though the mention of it
      recalled the feelings which he had then experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are your intentions about it all?&rdquo; I inquired, to divert him
      from such a disagreeable recollection. &ldquo;That is to say, how do you imagine
      it is going to turn out? Do you ever speak to her about the future, or
      about how your love or friendship are going to end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, do I intend to marry her eventually?&rdquo; he inquired, in his
      turn, with a renewed blush, but turning himself round and looking me
      boldly in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; I replied as I settled myself down. &ldquo;We are both of us
      grown-up, as well as friends, so we may as well discuss our future life as
      we drive along. No one could very well overlook or overhear us now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I NOT marry her?&rdquo; he went on in response to my reassuring
      reply. &ldquo;It is my aim&mdash;as it should be the aim of every honourable man&mdash;to
      be as good and as happy as possible; and with her, if she should still be
      willing when I have become more independent, I should be happier and
      better than with the greatest beauty in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in such conversation, we hardly noticed that we were approaching
      Kuntsevo, or that the sky was becoming overcast and beginning to threaten
      rain. On the right, the sun was slowly sinking behind the ancient trees of
      the Kuntsevo park&mdash;one half of its brilliant disc obscured with grey,
      subluminous cloud, and the other half sending forth spokes of flaming
      light which threw the old trees into striking relief as they stood there
      with their dense crowns of green showing against a blue patch of sky. The
      light and shimmer of that patch contrasted sharply with the heavy pink
      cloud which lay massed above a young birch-tree visible on the horizon
      before us, while, a little further to the right, the parti-coloured roofs
      of the Kuntsevo mansion could be seen projecting above a belt of trees and
      undergrowth&mdash;one side of them reflecting the glittering rays of the
      sun, and the other side harmonising with the more louring portion of the
      heavens. Below us, and to the left, showed the still blue of a pond where
      it lay surrounded with pale-green laburnums&mdash;its dull,
      concave-looking depths repeating the trees in more sombre shades of colour
      over the surface of a hillock. Beyond the water spread the black expanse
      of a ploughed field, with the straight line of a dark-green ridge by which
      it was bisected running far into the distance, and there joining the
      leaden, threatening horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On either side of the soft road along which the phaeton was pursuing the
      even tenour of its way, bright-green, tangled, juicy belts of rye were
      sprouting here and there into stalk. Not a motion was perceptible in the
      air, only a sweet freshness, and everything looked extraordinarily clear
      and bright. Near the road I could see a little brown path winding its way
      among the dark-green, quarter-grown stems of rye, and somehow that path
      reminded me vividly of our village, and somehow (through some connection
      of thought) the idea of that village reminded me vividly of Sonetchka, and
      so of the fact that I was in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding my fondness for Dimitri and the pleasure which his
      frankness had afforded me, I now felt as though I desired to hear no more
      about his feelings and intentions with regard to Lubov Sergievna, but to
      talk unstintedly about my own love for Sonetchka, who seemed to me an
      object of affection of a far higher order. Yet for some reason or another
      I could not make up my mind to tell him straight out how splendid it would
      seem when I had married Sonetchka and we were living in the country&mdash;of
      how we should have little children who would crawl about the floor and
      call me Papa, and of how delighted I should be when he, Dimitri, brought
      his wife, Lubov Sergievna, to see us, wearing an expensive gown.
      Accordingly, instead of saying all that, I pointed to the setting sun, and
      merely remarked: &ldquo;Look, Dimitri! How splendid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this, however, Dimitri made no reply, since he was evidently
      dissatisfied at my answering his confession (which it had cost him much to
      make) by directing his attention to natural objects (to which he was, in
      general, indifferent). Upon him Nature had an effect altogether different
      to what she had upon myself, for she affected him rather by her industry
      than by her beauty&mdash;he loved her rather with his intellect than with
      his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am absolutely happy,&rdquo; I went on, without noticing that he was
      altogether taken up with his own thoughts and oblivious of anything that I
      might be saying. &ldquo;You will remember how told you about a girl with whom I
      used to be in love when was a little boy? Well, I saw her again only this
      morning, and am now infatuated with her.&rdquo; Then I told him&mdash;despite
      his continued expression of indifference&mdash;about my love, and about
      all my plans for my future connubial happiness. Strangely enough, no
      sooner had I related in detail the whole strength of my feelings than I
      instantly became conscious of its diminution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain overtook us just as we were turning into the avenue of
      birch-trees which led to the house, but it did not really wet us. I only
      knew that it was raining by the fact that I felt a drop fall, first on my
      nose, and then on my hand, and heard something begin to patter upon the
      young, viscous leaves of the birch-trees as, drooping their curly branches
      overhead, they seemed to imbibe the pure, shining drops with an avidity
      which filled the whole avenue with scent. We descended from the carriage,
      so as to reach the house the quicker through the garden, but found
      ourselves confronted at the entrance-door by four ladies, two of whom were
      knitting, one reading a book, and the fourth walking to and fro with a
      little dog. Thereupon, Dimitri began to present me to his mother, sister,
      and aunt, as well as to Lubov Sergievna. For a moment they remained where
      they were, but almost instantly the rain became heavier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go into the verandah; you can present him to us there,&rdquo; said the
      lady whom I took to be Dimitri&rsquo;s mother, and we all of us ascended the
      entrance-steps.

    <h2>
      XXIII. THE NECHLUDOFFS
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the first, the member of this company who struck me the most was
      Lubov Sergievna, who, holding a lapdog in her arms and wearing stout laced
      boots, was the last of the four ladies to ascend the staircase, and twice
      stopped to gaze at me intently and then kiss her little dog. She was
      anything but good-looking, since she was red-haired, thin, short, and
      slightly crooked. What made her plain face all the plainer was the queer
      way in which her hair was parted to one side (it looked like the wigs
      which bald women contrive for themselves). However much I should have
      liked to applaud my friend, I could not find a single comely feature in
      her. Even her brown eyes, though expressive of good-humour, were small and
      dull&mdash;were, in fact, anything but pretty; while her hands (those most
      characteristic of features), were though neither large nor ill-shaped,
      coarse and red.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we reached the verandah, each of the ladies, except Dimitri&rsquo;s
      sister Varenika&mdash;who also had been regarding me attentively out of
      her large, dark-grey eyes&mdash;said a few words to me before resuming her
      occupation, while Varenika herself began to read aloud from a book which
      she held on her lap and steadied with her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Maria Ivanovna was a tall, well-built woman of forty. To
      judge by the curls of half-grey hair which descended below her cap one
      might have taken her for more, but as soon as ever one observed the fresh,
      extraordinarily tender, and almost wrinkleless face, as well as, most of
      all, the lively, cheerful sparkle of the large eyes, one involuntarily
      took her for less. Her eyes were black and very frank, her lips thin and
      slightly severe, her nose regular and slightly inclined to the left, and
      her hands ringless, large, and almost like those of a man, but with finely
      tapering fingers. She wore a dark-blue dress fastened to the throat and
      sitting closely to her firm, still youthful waist&mdash;a waist which she
      evidently pinched. Lastly, she held herself very upright, and was knitting
      a garment of some kind. As soon as I stepped on to the verandah she took
      me by the hand, drew me to her as though wishing to scrutinise me more
      closely, and said, as she gazed at me with the same cold, candid glance as
      her son&rsquo;s, that she had long known me by report from Dimitri, and that
      therefore, in order to make my acquaintance thoroughly, she had invited me
      to stay these twenty-four hours in her house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do just as you please here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and stand on no ceremony whatever
      with us, even as we shall stand on none with you. Pray walk, read, listen,
      or sleep as the mood may take you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophia Ivanovna was an old maid and the Princess&rsquo;s younger sister, though
      she looked the elder of the two. She had that exceedingly overstuffed
      appearance which old maids always present who are short of stature but
      wear corsets. It seemed as though her healthiness had shifted upwards to
      the point of choking her, her short, fat hands would not meet below her
      projecting bust, and the line of her waist was scarcely visible at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding that the Princess Maria Ivanovna had black hair and eyes,
      while Sophia Ivanovna had white hair and large, vivacious, tranquilly blue
      eyes (a rare combination), there was a great likeness between the two
      sisters, for they had the same expression, nose, and lips. The only
      difference was that Sophia&rsquo;s nose and lips were a trifle coarser than
      Maria&rsquo;s, and that, when she smiled, those features inclined towards the
      right, whereas Maria&rsquo;s inclined towards the left. Sophia, to judge by her
      dress and coiffure, was still youthful at heart, and would never have
      displayed grey curls, even if she had possessed them. Yet at first her
      glance and bearing towards me seemed very proud, and made me nervous,
      whereas I at once felt at home with the Princess. Perhaps it was only
      Sophia&rsquo;s stoutness and a certain resemblance to portraits of Catherine the
      Great that gave her, in my eyes, a haughty aspect, but at all events I
      felt quite intimidated when she looked at me intently and said, &ldquo;Friends
      of our friends are our friends also.&rdquo; I became reassured and changed my
      opinion about her only when, after saying those words, she opened her
      mouth and sighed deeply. It may be that she owed her habit of sighing
      after every few words&mdash;with a great distention of the mouth and a
      slight drooping of her large blue eyes&mdash;to her stoutness, yet it was
      none the less one which expressed so much good-humour that I at once lost
      all fear of her, and found her actually attractive. Her eyes were
      charming, her voice pleasant and musical, and even the flowing lines of
      her fullness seemed to my youthful vision not wholly lacking in beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had imagined that Lubov Sergievna, as my friend&rsquo;s friend, would at once
      say something friendly and familiar to me; yet, after gazing at me fixedly
      for a while, as though in doubt whether the remark she was about to make
      to me would not be too friendly, she at length asked me what faculty I was
      in. After that she stared at me as before, in evident hesitation as to
      whether or not to say something civil and familiar, until, remarking her
      perplexity, I besought her with a look to speak freely. Yet all she then
      said was, &ldquo;They tell me the Universities pay very little attention to
      science now,&rdquo; and turned away to call her little dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that evening she spoke only in disjointed fragments of this kind&mdash;fragments
      which had no connection either with the point or with one another; yet I
      had such faith in Dimitri, and he so often kept looking from her to me
      with an expression which mutely asked me, &ldquo;Now, what do you think of
      that?&rdquo; that, though I entirely failed to persuade myself that in Lubov
      Sergievna there was anything to speak of, I could not bear to express the
      thought, even to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the last member of the family, Varenika, she was a well-developed
      girl of sixteen. The only good features in her were a pair of dark-grey
      eyes,&mdash;which, in their expression of gaiety mingled with quiet
      attention, greatly resembled those of her aunt&mdash;a long coil of flaxen
      hair, and extremely delicate, beautiful hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect, Monsieur Nicolas, you find it wearisome to hear a story begun
      from the middle?&rdquo; said Sophia Ivanovna with her good-natured sigh as she
      turned over some pieces of clothing which she was sewing. The reading
      aloud had ceased for the moment because Dimitri had left the room on some
      errand or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or perhaps you have read Rob Roy before?&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that period I thought it incumbent upon me, in virtue of my student&rsquo;s
      uniform, to reply in a very &ldquo;clever and original&rdquo; manner to every question
      put to me by people whom I did not know very well, and regarded such
      short, clear answers as &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; &ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not care for
      it,&rdquo; as things to be ashamed of. Accordingly, looking down at my new and
      fashionably-cut trousers and the glittering buttons of my tunic, I replied
      that I had never read Rob Roy, but that it interested me greatly to hear
      it, since I preferred to read books from the middle rather than from the
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is twice as interesting,&rdquo; I added with a self-satisfied smirk; &ldquo;for
      then one can guess what has gone before as well as what is to come after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess smiled what I thought was a forced smile, but one which I
      discovered later to be her only one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps that is true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But tell me, Nicolas (you will
      not be offended if I drop the Monsieur)&mdash;tell me, are you going to be
      in town long? When do you go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know quite. Perhaps to-morrow, or perhaps not for some while
      yet,&rdquo; I replied for some reason or another, though I knew perfectly well
      that in reality we were to go to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could stop longer, both for your own sake and for Dimitri&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
       she said in a meditative manner. &ldquo;At your age friendship is a weak thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt that every one was looking at me, and waiting to see what I should
      say&mdash;though certainly Varenika made a pretence of looking at her
      aunt&rsquo;s work. I felt, in fact, as though I were being put through an
      examination, and that it behoved me to figure in it as well as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to ME Dimitri&rsquo;s friendship is most useful,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but to HIM
      mine cannot be of any use at all, since he is a thousand times better than
      I.&rdquo; (Dimitri could not hear what I said, or I should have feared his
      detecting the insincerity of my words.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Princess smiled her unnatural, yet characteristically natural,
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just listen to him!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it is YOU who are the little monster
      of perfection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Monster of perfection,&rsquo;&rdquo; I thought to myself. &ldquo;That is splendid. I must
      make a note of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, to dismiss yourself, he has been extraordinarily clever in that
      quarter,&rdquo; she went on in a lower tone (which pleased me somehow) as she
      indicated Lubov Sergievna with her eyes, &ldquo;since he has discovered in our
      poor little Auntie&rdquo; (such was the pet name which they gave Lubov) &ldquo;all
      sorts of perfections which I, who have known her and her little dog for
      twenty years, had never yet suspected. Varenika, go and tell them to bring
      me a glass of water,&rdquo; she added, letting her eyes wander again. Probably
      she had bethought her that it was too soon, or not entirely necessary, to
      let me into all the family secrets. &ldquo;Yet no&mdash;let HIM go, for he has
      nothing to do, while you are reading. Pray go to the door, my friend,&rdquo; she
      said to me, &ldquo;and walk about fifteen steps down the passage. Then halt and
      call out pretty loudly, &lsquo;Peter, bring Maria Ivanovna a glass of iced
      water&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;and she smiled her curious smile once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect she wants to say something about me in my absence,&rdquo; I thought to
      myself as I left the room. &ldquo;I expect she wants to remark that she can see
      very clearly that I am a very, very clever young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had I taken a dozen steps when I was overtaken by Sophia Ivanovna,
      who, though fat and short of breath, trod with surprising lightness and
      agility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merci, mon cher,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will go and tell them myself.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXIV. LOVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      SOPHIA IVANOVNA, as I afterwards came to know her, was one of those rare,
      young-old women who are born for family life, but to whom that happiness
      has been denied by fate. Consequently all that store of their love which
      should have been poured out upon a husband and children becomes pent up in
      their hearts, until they suddenly decide to let it overflow upon a few
      chosen individuals. Yet so inexhaustible is that store of old maids&rsquo; love
      that, despite the number of individuals so selected, there still remains
      an abundant surplus of affection which they lavish upon all by whom they
      are surrounded&mdash;upon all, good or bad, whom they may chance to meet
      in their daily life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of love there are three kinds&mdash;love of beauty, the love which denies
      itself, and practical love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the desire of a young man for a young woman, as well as of the reverse
      instance, I am not now speaking, for of such tendresses I am wary, seeing
      that I have been too unhappy in my life to have been able ever to see in
      such affection a single spark of truth, but rather a lying pretence in
      which sensuality, connubial relations, money, and the wish to bind hands
      or to unloose them have rendered feeling such a complex affair as to defy
      analysis. Rather am I speaking of that love for a human being which,
      according to the spiritual strength of its possessor, concentrates itself
      either upon a single individual, upon a few, or upon many&mdash;of love
      for a mother, a father, a brother, little children, a friend, a compatriot&mdash;of
      love, in short, for one&rsquo;s neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love of beauty consists in a love of the sense of beauty and of its
      expression. People who thus love conceive the object of their affection to
      be desirable only in so far as it arouses in them that pleasurable
      sensation of which the consciousness and the expression soothes the
      senses. They change the object of their love frequently, since their
      principal aim consists in ensuring that the voluptuous feeling of their
      adoration shall be constantly titillated. To preserve in themselves this
      sensuous condition, they talk unceasingly, and in the most elegant terms,
      on the subject of the love which they feel, not only for its immediate
      object, but also for objects upon which it does not touch at all. This
      country of ours contains many such individuals&mdash;individuals of that
      well-known class who, cultivating &ldquo;the beautiful,&rdquo; not only discourse of
      their cult to all and sundry, but speak of it pre-eminently in FRENCH. It
      may seem a strange and ridiculous thing to say, but I am convinced that
      among us we have had in the past, and still have, a large section of
      society&mdash;notably women&mdash;whose love for their friends, husbands,
      or children would expire to-morrow if they were debarred from dilating
      upon it in the tongue of France!
    </p>
    <p>
      Love of the second kind&mdash;renunciatory love&mdash;consists in a
      yearning to undergo self-sacrifice for the object beloved, regardless of
      any consideration whether such self-sacrifice will benefit or injure the
      object in question. &ldquo;There is no evil which I would not endure to show
      both the world and him or her whom I adore my devotion.&rdquo; There we have the
      formula of this kind of love. People who thus love never look for
      reciprocity of affection, since it is a finer thing to sacrifice yourself
      for one who does not comprehend you. Also, they are always painfully eager
      to exaggerate the merits of their sacrifice; usually constant in their
      love, for the reason that they would find it hard to forego the kudos of
      the deprivations which they endure for the object beloved; always ready to
      die, to prove to him or to her the entirety of their devotion; but sparing
      of such small daily proofs of their love as call for no special effort of
      self-immolation. They do not much care whether you eat well, sleep well,
      keep your spirits up, or enjoy good health, nor do they ever do anything
      to obtain for you those blessings if they have it in their power; but,
      should you be confronting a bullet, or have fallen into the water, or
      stand in danger of being burnt, or have had your heart broken in a love
      affair&mdash;well, for all these things they are prepared if the occasion
      should arise. Moreover, people addicted to love of such a self-sacrificing
      order are invariably proud of their love, exacting, jealous, distrustful,
      and&mdash;strange to tell&mdash;anxious that the object of their adoration
      should incur perils (so that they may save it from calamity, and console
      it thereafter) and even be vicious (so that they may purge it of its
      vice).
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose, now, that you are living in the country with a wife who loves you
      in this self-sacrificing manner. You may be healthy and contented, and
      have occupations which interest you, while, on the other hand, your wife
      may be too weak to superintend the household work (which, in consequence,
      will be left to the servants), or to look after the children (who, in
      consequence, will be left to the nurses), or to put her heart into any
      work whatsoever: and all because she loves nobody and nothing but
      yourself. She may be patently ill, yet she will say not a word to you
      about it, for fear of distressing you. She may be patently ennuyee, yet
      for your sake she will be prepared to be so for the rest of her life. She
      may be patently depressed because you stick so persistently to your
      occupations (whether sport, books, farming, state service, or anything
      else) and see clearly that they are doing you harm; yet, for all that, she
      will keep silence, and suffer it to be so. Yet, should you but fall sick&mdash;and,
      despite her own ailments and your prayers that she will not distress
      herself in vain, your loving wife will remain sitting inseparably by your
      bedside. Every moment you will feel her sympathetic gaze resting upon you
      and, as it were, saying: &ldquo;There! I told you so, but it is all one to me,
      and I shall not leave you.&rdquo; In the morning you maybe a little better, and
      move into another room. The room, however, will be insufficiently warmed
      or set in order; the soup which alone you feel you could eat will not have
      been cooked; nor will any medicine have been sent for. Yet, though worn
      out with night watching, your loving wife will continue to regard you with
      an expression of sympathy, to walk about on tiptoe, and to whisper
      unaccustomed and obscure orders to the servants. You may wish to be read
      to&mdash;and your loving wife will tell you with a sigh that she feels
      sure you will be unable to hear her reading, and only grow angry at her
      awkwardness in doing it; wherefore you had better not be read to at all.
      You may wish to walk about the room&mdash;and she will tell you that it
      would be far better for you not to do so. You may wish to talk with some
      friends who have called&mdash;and she will tell you that talking is not
      good for you. At nightfall the fever may come upon you again, and you may
      wish to be left alone whereupon your loving wife, though wasted, pale, and
      full of yawns, will go on sitting in a chair opposite you, as dusk falls,
      until her very slightest movement, her very slightest sound, rouses you to
      feelings of anger and impatience. You may have a servant who has lived
      with you for twenty years, and to whom you are attached, and who would
      tend you well and to your satisfaction during the night, for the reason
      that he has been asleep all day and is, moreover, paid a salary for his
      services; yet your wife will not suffer him to wait upon you. No;
      everything she must do herself with her weak, unaccustomed fingers (of
      which you follow the movements with suppressed irritation as those pale
      members do their best to uncork a medicine bottle, to snuff a candle, to
      pour out physic, or to touch you in a squeamish sort of way). If you are
      an impatient, hasty sort of man, and beg of her to leave the room, you
      will hear by the vexed, distressed sounds which come from her that she is
      humbly sobbing and weeping behind the door, and whispering foolishness of
      some kind to the servant. Finally if you do not die, your loving wife&mdash;who
      has not slept during the whole three weeks of your illness (a fact of
      which she will constantly remind you)&mdash;will fall ill in her turn,
      waste away, suffer much, and become even more incapable of any useful
      pursuit than she was before; while by the time that you have regained your
      normal state of health she will express to you her self-sacrificing
      affection only by shedding around you a kind of benignant dullness which
      involuntarily communicates itself both to yourself and to every one else
      in your vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third kind of love&mdash;practical love&mdash;consists of a yearning
      to satisfy every need, every desire, every caprice, nay, every vice, of
      the being beloved. People who love thus always love their life long,
      since, the more they love, the more they get to know the object beloved,
      and the easier they find the task of loving it&mdash;that is to say, of
      satisfying its desires. Their love seldom finds expression in words, but
      if it does so, it expresses itself neither with assurance nor beauty, but
      rather in a shamefaced, awkward manner, since people of this kind
      invariably have misgivings that they are loving unworthily. People of this
      kind love even the faults of their adored one, for the reason that those
      faults afford them the power of constantly satisfying new desires. They
      look for their affection to be returned, and even deceive themselves into
      believing that it is returned, and are happy accordingly: yet in the
      reverse case they will still continue to desire happiness for their
      beloved one, and try by every means in their power&mdash;whether moral or
      material, great or small&mdash;to provide it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such practical love it was&mdash;love for her nephew, for her niece, for
      her sister, for Lubov Sergievna, and even for myself, because I loved
      Dimitri&mdash;that shone in the eyes, as well as in the every word and
      movement, of Sophia Ivanovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only long afterwards did I learn to value her at her true worth. Yet even
      now the question occurred to me: &ldquo;What has made Dimitri&mdash;who
      throughout has tried to understand love differently to other young
      fellows, and has always had before his eyes the gentle, loving Sophia
      Ivanovna&mdash;suddenly fall so deeply in love with the incomprehensible
      Lubov Sergievna, and declare that in his aunt he can only find good
      QUALITIES? Verily it is a true saying that &lsquo;a prophet hath no honour in
      his own country.&rsquo; One of two things: either every man has in him more of
      bad than of good, or every man is more receptive to bad than to good.
      Lubov Sergievna he has not known for long, whereas his aunt&rsquo;s love he has
      known since the day of his birth.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXV. I BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE NECHLUDOFFS
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN I returned to the verandah, I found that they were not talking of me
      at all, as I had anticipated. On the contrary, Varenika had laid aside the
      book, and was engaged in a heated dispute with Dimitri, who, for his part,
      was walking up and down the verandah, and frowningly adjusting his neck in
      his collar as he did so. The subject of the quarrel seemed to be Ivan
      Yakovlevitch and superstition, but it was too animated a difference for
      its underlying cause not to be something which concerned the family much
      more nearly. Although the Princess and Lubov Sergievna were sitting by in
      silence, they were following every word, and evidently tempted at times to
      take part in the dispute; yet always, just when they were about to speak,
      they checked themselves, and left the field clear for the two principles,
      Dimitri and Varenika. On my entry, the latter glanced at me with such an
      indifferent air that I could see she was wholly absorbed in the quarrel
      and did not care whether she spoke in my presence or not. The Princess too
      looked the same, and was clearly on Varenika&rsquo;s side, while Dimitri began,
      if anything, to raise his voice still more when I appeared, and Lubov
      Sergievna, for her part, observed to no one in particular: &ldquo;Old people are
      quite right when they say, &lsquo;Si jeunesse savait, si vieillesse pouvait.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless this quotation did not check the dispute, though it somehow
      gave me the impression that the side represented by the speaker and her
      friend was in the wrong. Although it was a little awkward for me to be
      present at a petty family difference, the fact that the true relations of
      the family revealed themselves during its progress, and that my presence
      did nothing to hinder that revelation, afforded me considerable
      gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      How often it happens that for years one sees a family cover themselves
      over with a conventional cloak of decorum, and preserve the real relations
      of its members a secret from every eye! How often, too, have I remarked
      that, the more impenetrable (and therefore the more decorous) is the
      cloak, the harsher are the relations which it conceals! Yet, once let some
      unexpected question&mdash;often a most trivial one (the colour of a
      woman&rsquo;s hair, a visit, a man&rsquo;s horses, and so forth)&mdash;arise in that
      family circle, and without any visible cause there will also arise an
      ever-growing difference, until in time the cloak of decorum becomes
      unequal to confining the quarrel within due bounds, and, to the dismay of
      the disputants and the astonishment of the auditors, the real and
      ill-adjusted relations of the family are laid bare, and the cloak, now
      useless for concealment, is bandied from hand to hand among the contending
      factions until it serves only to remind one of the years during which it
      successfully deceived one&rsquo;s perceptions. Sometimes to strike one&rsquo;s head
      violently against a ceiling hurts one less than just to graze some spot
      which has been hurt and bruised before: and in almost every family there
      exists some such raw and tender spot. In the Nechludoff family that spot
      was Dimitri&rsquo;s extraordinary affection for Lubov Sergievna, which aroused
      in the mother and sister, if not a jealous feeling, at all events a sense
      of hurt family pride. This was the grave significance which underlay, for
      all those present, the seeming dispute about Ivan Yakovlevitch and
      superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In anything that other people deride and despise you invariably profess
      to see something extraordinarily good!&rdquo; Varenika was saying in her clear
      voice, as she articulated each syllable with careful precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; retorted Dimitri with an impatient toss of his head. &ldquo;Now, in
      the first place, only a most unthinking person could ever speak of
      DESPISING such a remarkable man as Ivan Yakovlevitch, while, in the second
      place, it is YOU who invariably profess to see nothing good in what
      confronts you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Sophia Ivanovna kept looking anxiously at us as she turned first
      to her nephew, and then to her niece, and then to myself. Twice she opened
      her mouth as though to say what was in her mind and drew a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Varia, PLEASE go on reading,&rdquo; she said at length, at the same time
      handing her niece the book, and patting her hand kindly. &ldquo;I wish to know
      whether he ever found HER again&rdquo; (as a matter of fact, the novel in
      question contained not a word about any one finding any one else). &ldquo;And,
      Mitia dear,&rdquo; she added to her nephew, despite the glum looks which he was
      throwing at her for having interrupted the logical thread of his
      deductions, &ldquo;you had better let me poultice your cheek, or your teeth will
      begin to ache again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that the reading was resumed. Yet the quarrel had in no way
      dispelled the calm atmosphere of family and intellectual harmony which
      enveloped this circle of ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly deriving its inspiration and character from the Princess Maria
      Ivanovna, it was a circle which, for me, had a wholly novel and attractive
      character of logicalness mingled with simplicity and refinement. That
      character I could discern in the daintiness, good taste, and solidity of
      everything about me, whether the handbell, the binding of the book, the
      settee, or the table. Likewise, I divined it in the upright, well-corseted
      pose of the Princess, in her pendant curls of grey hair, in the manner in
      which she had, at our first introduction, called me plain &ldquo;Nicolas&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;he,&rdquo; in the occupations of the ladies (the reading and the sewing of
      garments), and in the unusual whiteness of their hands. Those hands, en
      passant, showed a family feature common to all&mdash;namely, the feature
      that the flesh of the palm on the outer side was rosy in colour, and
      divided by a sharp, straight line from the pure whiteness of the upper
      portion of the hand. Still more was the character of this feminine circle
      expressed in the manner in which the three ladies spoke Russian and French&mdash;spoke
      them, that is to say, with perfect articulation of syllables and pedantic
      accuracy of substantives and prepositions. All this, and more especially
      the fact that the ladies treated me as simply and as seriously as a real
      grown-up&mdash;telling me their opinions, and listening to my own (a thing
      to which I was so little accustomed that, for all my glittering buttons
      and blue facings, I was in constant fear of being told: &ldquo;Surely you do not
      think that we are talking SERIOUSLY to you? Go away and learn something&rdquo;)&mdash;all
      this, I say, caused me to feel an entire absence of restraint in this
      society. I ventured at times to rise, to move about, and to talk boldly to
      each of the ladies except Varenika (whom I always felt it was unbecoming,
      or even forbidden, for me to address unless she first spoke to me).
    </p>
    <p>
      As I listened to her clear, pleasant voice reading aloud, I kept glancing
      from her to the path of the flower-garden, where the rain-spots were
      making small dark circles in the sand, and thence to the lime-trees, upon
      the leaves of which the rain was pattering down in large detached drops
      shed from the pale, shimmering edge of the livid blue cloud which hung
      suspended over us. Then I would glance at her again, and then at the last
      purple rays of the setting sun where they were throwing the dense clusters
      of old, rain-washed birches into brilliant relief. Yet again my eyes would
      return to Varenika, and, each time that they did so, it struck me afresh
      that she was not nearly so plain as at first I had thought her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I wish that I wasn&rsquo;t in love already!&rdquo; I reflected, &ldquo;or that
      Sonetchka was Varenika! How nice it would be if suddenly I could become a
      member of this family, and have the three ladies for my mother, aunt, and
      wife respectively!&rdquo; All the time that these thoughts kept passing through
      my head I kept attentively regarding Varenika as she read, until somehow I
      felt as though I were magnetising her, and that presently she must look at
      me. Sure enough, at length she raised her head, threw me a glance, and,
      meeting my eyes, turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rain does not seem to stop,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a new feeling came over me. I began to feel as though everything
      now happening to me was a repetition of some similar occurrence before&mdash;as
      though on some previous occasion a shower of rain had begun to fall, and
      the sun had set behind birch-trees, and I had been looking at her, and she
      had been reading aloud, and I had magnetised her, and she had looked up at
      me. Yes, all this I seemed to recall as though it had happened once
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely she is not&mdash;SHE?&rdquo; was my thought. &ldquo;Surely IT is not
      beginning?&rdquo; However, I soon decided that Varenika was not the &ldquo;SHE&rdquo;
       referred to, and that &ldquo;it&rdquo; was not &ldquo;beginning.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; I
      said to myself, &ldquo;Varenika is not at all BEAUTIFUL. She is just an ordinary
      girl whose acquaintance I have made in the ordinary way, whereas the she
      whom I shall meet somewhere and some day and in some not ordinary way will
      be anything but ordinary. This family pleases me so much only because
      hitherto I have never seen anybody. Such things will always be happening
      in the future, and I shall see many more such families during my life.&rdquo;

      XXVI. I SHOW OFF
    </h2>
    <p>
      AT tea time the reading came to an end, and the ladies began to talk among
      themselves of persons and things unknown to me. This I conceived them to
      be doing on purpose to make me conscious (for all their kind demeanour) of
      the difference which years and position in the world had set between them
      and myself. In general discussions, however, in which I could take part I
      sought to atone for my late silence by exhibiting that extraordinary
      cleverness and originality to which I felt compelled by my University
      uniform. For instance, when the conversation turned upon country houses, I
      said that Prince Ivan Ivanovitch had a villa near Moscow which people came
      to see even from London and Paris, and that it contained balustrading
      which had cost 380,000 roubles. Likewise, I remarked that the Prince was a
      very near relation of mine, and that, when lunching with him the same day,
      he had invited me to go and spend the entire summer with him at that
      villa, but that I had declined, since I knew the villa well, and had
      stayed in it more than once, and that all those balustradings and bridges
      did not interest me, since I could not bear ornamental work, especially in
      the country, where I liked everything to be wholly countrified. After
      delivering myself of this extraordinary and complicated romance, I grew
      confused, and blushed so much that every one must have seen that I was
      lying. Both Varenika, who was handing me a cup of tea, and Sophia
      Ivanovna, who had been gazing at me throughout, turned their heads away,
      and began to talk of something else with an expression which I afterwards
      learnt that good-natured people assume when a very young man has told them
      a manifest string of lies&mdash;an expression which says, &ldquo;Yes, we know he
      is lying, and why he is doing it, the poor young fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What I had said about Prince Ivan Ivanovitch having a country villa, I had
      related simply because I could find no other pretext for mentioning both
      my relationship to the Prince and the fact that I had been to luncheon
      with him that day; yet why I had said all I had about the balustrading
      costing 380,000 roubles, and about my having several times visited the
      Prince at that villa (I had never once been there&mdash;more especially
      since the Prince possessed no residences save in Moscow and Naples, as the
      Nechludoffs very well knew), I could not possibly tell you. Neither in
      childhood nor in adolescence nor in riper years did I ever remark in
      myself the vice of falsehood&mdash;on the contrary, I was, if anything,
      too outspoken and truthful. Yet, during this first stage of my manhood, I
      often found myself seized with a strange and unreasonable tendency to lie
      in the most desperate fashion. I say advisedly &ldquo;in the most desperate
      fashion,&rdquo; for the reason that I lied in matters in which it was the
      easiest thing in the world to detect me. On the whole I think that a
      vain-glorious desire to appear different from what I was, combined with an
      impossible hope that the lie would never be found out, was the chief cause
      of this extraordinary impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea, since the rain had stopped and the after-glow of sunset was
      calm and clear, the Princess proposed that we should go and stroll in the
      lower garden, and admire her favourite spots there. Following my rule to
      be always original, and conceiving that clever people like myself and the
      Princess must surely be above the banalities of politeness, I replied that
      I could not bear a walk with no object in view, and that, if I DID walk, I
      liked to walk alone. I had no idea that this speech was simply rude; all I
      thought was that, even as nothing could be more futile than empty
      compliments, so nothing could be more pleasing and original than a little
      frank brusquerie. However, though much pleased with my answer, I set out
      with the rest of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess&rsquo;s favourite spot of all was at the very bottom of the lower
      garden, where a little bridge spanned a narrow piece of swamp. The view
      there was very restricted, yet very intimate and pleasing. We are so
      accustomed to confound art with nature that, often enough, phenomena of
      nature which are never to be met with in pictures seem to us unreal, and
      give us the impression that nature is unnatural, or vice versa; whereas
      phenomena of nature which occur with too much frequency in pictures seem
      to us hackneyed, and views which are to be met with in real life, but
      which appear to us too penetrated with a single idea or a single
      sentiment, seem to us arabesques. The view from the Princess&rsquo;s favourite
      spot was as follows. On the further side of a small lake, over-grown with
      weeds round its edges, rose a steep ascent covered with bushes and with
      huge old trees of many shades of green, while, overhanging the lake at the
      foot of the ascent, stood an ancient birch tree which, though partly
      supported by stout roots implanted in the marshy bank of the lake, rested
      its crown upon a tall, straight poplar, and dangled its curved branches
      over the smooth surface of the pond&mdash;both branches and the
      surrounding greenery being reflected therein as in a mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; said the Princess with a nod of her head, and addressing no
      one in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, marvellous!&rdquo; I replied in my desire to show that had an opinion of
      my own on every subject. &ldquo;Yet somehow it all looks to me so terribly like
      a scheme of decoration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess went on gazing at the scene as though she had not heard me,
      and turning to her sister and Lubov Sergievna at intervals, in order to
      point out to them its details&mdash;especially a curved, pendent bough,
      with its reflection in the water, which particularly pleased her. Sophia
      Ivanovna observed to me that it was all very beautiful, and that she and
      her sister would sometimes spend hours together at this spot; yet it was
      clear that her remarks were meant merely to please the Princess. I have
      noticed that people who are gifted with the faculty of loving are seldom
      receptive to the beauties of nature. Lubov Sergievna also seemed
      enraptured, and asked (among other things), &ldquo;How does that birch tree
      manage to support itself? Has it stood there long?&rdquo; Yet the next moment
      she became absorbed in contemplation of her little dog Susetka, which,
      with its stumpy paws pattering to and fro upon the bridge in a mincing
      fashion, seemed to say by the expression of its face that this was the
      first time it had ever found itself out of doors. As for Dimitri, he fell
      to discoursing very logically to his mother on the subject of how no view
      can be beautiful of which the horizon is limited. Varenika alone said
      nothing. Glancing at her, I saw that she was leaning over the parapet of
      the bridge, her profile turned towards me, and gazing straight in front of
      her. Something seemed to be interesting her deeply, or even affecting her,
      since it was clear that she was oblivious to her surroundings, and
      thinking neither of herself nor of the fact that any one might be
      regarding her. In the expression of her large eyes there was nothing but
      wrapt attention and quiet, concentrated thought, while her whole attitude
      seemed so unconstrained and, for all her shortness, so dignified that once
      more some recollection or another touched me and once more I asked myself,
      &ldquo;Is IT, then, beginning?&rdquo; Yet again I assured myself that I was already in
      love with Sonetchka, and that Varenika was only an ordinary girl, the
      sister of my friend. Though she pleased me at that moment, I somehow felt
      a vague desire to show her, by word or deed, some small unfriendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what, Dimitri,&rdquo; I said to my friend as I moved nearer to
      Varenika, so that she might overhear what I was going to say, &ldquo;it seems to
      me that, even if there had been no mosquitos here, there would have been
      nothing to commend this spot; whereas &ldquo;&mdash;and here I slapped my cheek,
      and in very truth annihilated one of those insects&mdash;&ldquo;it is simply
      awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do not care for nature?&rdquo; said Varenika without turning her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it a foolish, futile pursuit,&rdquo; I replied, well satisfied that I
      had said something to annoy her, as well as something original. Varenika
      only raised her eyebrows a little, with an expression of pity, and went on
      gazing in front of her as calmly as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt vexed with her. Yet, for all that, the rusty, paint-blistered
      parapet on which she was leaning, the way in which the dark waters of the
      pond reflected the drooping branch of the overhanging birch tree (it
      almost seemed to me as though branch and its reflection met), the rising
      odour of the swamp, the feeling of crushed mosquito on my cheek, and her
      absorbed look and statuesque pose&mdash;many times afterwards did these
      things recur with unexpected vividness to my recollection.

    <h2>
      XXVII. DIMITRI
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN we returned to the house from our stroll, Varenika declined to sing
      as she usually did in the evenings, and I was conceited enough to
      attribute this to my doing, in the belief that its reason lay in what I
      had said on the bridge. The Nechludoffs never had supper, and went to bed
      early, while to-night, since Dimitri had the toothache (as Sophia Ivanovna
      had foretold), he departed with me to his room even earlier than usual.
      Feeling that I had done all that was required of me by my blue collar and
      gilt buttons, and that every one was very pleased with me, I was in a
      gratified, complacent mood, while Dimitri, on the other hand, was rendered
      by his quarrel with his sister and the toothache both taciturn and gloomy.
      He sat down at the table, got out a couple of notebooks&mdash;a diary and
      the copy-book in which it was his custom every evening to inscribe the
      tasks performed by or awaiting him&mdash;and, continually frowning and
      touching his cheek with his hand, continued writing for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, DO leave me alone!&rdquo; he cried to the maid whom Sophia Ivanovna sent to
      ask him whether his teeth were still hurting him, and whether he would not
      like to have a poultice made. Then, saying that my bed would soon be ready
      for me and that he would be back presently, he departed to Lubov
      Sergievna&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity that Varenika is not good-looking and, in general,
      Sonetchka!&rdquo; I reflected when I found myself alone. &ldquo;How nice it would be
      if, after I have left the University, I could go to her and offer her my
      hand! I would say to her, &lsquo;Princess, though no longer young, and therefore
      unable to love passionately, I will cherish you as a dear sister. And
      you,&rsquo; I would continue to her mother, &lsquo;I greatly respect; and you, Sophia
      Ivanovna, I value highly. Therefore say to me, Varenika (since I ask you
      to be my wife), just the simple and direct word YES.&rsquo; And she would give
      me her hand, and I should press it, and say, &lsquo;Mine is a love which depends
      not upon words, but upon deeds.&rsquo; And suppose,&rdquo; next came into my head,
      &ldquo;that Dimitri should suddenly fall in love with Lubotshka (as Lubotshka
      has already done with him), and should desire to marry her? Then either
      one or the other of us would have to resign all thought of marriage. Well,
      it would be splendid, for in that case I should act thus. As soon as I had
      noticed how things were, I should make no remark, but go to Dimitri and
      say, &lsquo;It is no use, my friend, for you and I to conceal our feelings from
      one another. You know that my love for your sister will terminate only
      with my life. Yet I know all; and though you have deprived me of all hope,
      and have rendered me an unhappy man, so that Nicolas Irtenieff will have
      to bewail his misery for the rest of his existence, yet do you take my
      sister,&rsquo; and I should lay his hand in Lubotshka&rsquo;s. Then he would say to
      me, &lsquo;No, not for all the world!&rsquo; and I should reply, &lsquo;Prince Nechludoff,
      it is in vain for you to attempt to outdo me in nobility. Not in the whole
      world does there exist a more magnanimous being than Nicolas Irtenieff.&rsquo; 
      Then I should salute him and depart. In tears Dimitri and Lubotshka would
      pursue me, and entreat me to accept their sacrifice, and I should consent
      to do so, and, perhaps, be happy ever afterwards&mdash;if only I were in
      love with Varenika.&rdquo; These fancies tickled my imagination so pleasantly
      that I felt as though I should like to communicate them to my friend; yet,
      despite our mutual vow of frankness, I also felt as though I had not the
      physical energy to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimitri returned from Lubov Sergievna&rsquo;s room with some toothache capsules
      which she had given him, yet in even greater pain, and therefore in even
      greater depression, than before. Evidently no bedroom had yet been
      prepared for me, for presently the boy who acted as Dimitri&rsquo;s valet
      arrived to ask him where I was to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go to the devil!&rdquo; cried Dimitri, stamping his foot. &ldquo;Vasika, Vasika,
      Vasika!&rdquo; he went on, the instant that the boy had left the room, with a
      gradual raising of his voice at each repetition. &ldquo;Vasika, lay me out a bed
      on the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, let ME sleep on the floor,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is all one. Lie anywhere you like,&rdquo; continued Dimitri in the
      same angry tone. &ldquo;Vasika, why don&rsquo;t you go and do what I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently Vasika did not understand what was demanded of him, for he
      remained where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you? Go and lay the bed, Vasika, I tell you!&rdquo;
       shouted Dimitri, suddenly bursting into a sort of frenzy; yet Vasika still
      did not understand, but, blushing hotly, stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are determined to drive me mad, are you?&rdquo;&mdash;and leaping from
      his chair and rushing upon the boy, Dimitri struck him on the head with
      the whole weight of his fist, until the boy rushed headlong from the room.
      Halting in the doorway, Dimitri glanced at me, and the expression of fury
      and pain which had sat for a moment on his countenance suddenly gave place
      to such a boyish, kindly, affectionate, yet ashamed, expression that I
      felt sorry for him, and reconsidered my intention of leaving him to
      himself. He said nothing, but for a long time paced the room in silence,
      occasionally glancing at me with the same deprecatory expression as
      before. Then he took his notebook from the table, wrote something in it,
      took off his jacket and folded it carefully, and, stepping into the corner
      where the ikon hung, knelt down and began to say his prayers, with his
      large white hands folded upon his breast. So long did he pray that Vasika
      had time to bring a mattress and spread it, under my whispered directions,
      on the floor. Indeed, I had undressed and laid myself down upon the
      mattress before Dimitri had finished. As I contemplated his slightly
      rounded back and the soles of his feet (which somehow seemed to stick out
      in my direction in a sort of repentant fashion whenever he made his
      obeisances), I felt that I liked him more than ever, and debated within
      myself whether or not I should tell him all I had been fancying concerning
      our respective sisters. When he had finished his prayers, he lay down upon
      the bed near me, and, propping himself upon his elbow, looked at me in
      silence, with a kindly, yet abashed, expression. Evidently he found it
      difficult to do this, yet meant thus to punish himself. Then I smiled and
      returned his gaze, and he smiled back at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not tell me that my conduct has been abominable?&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;You have been thinking so, have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied; and although it was something quite different which had
      been in my mind, it now seemed to me that that was what I had been
      thinking. &ldquo;Yes, it was not right of you, nor should I have expected it of
      you.&rdquo; It pleased me particularly at that moment to call him by the
      familiar second person singular. &ldquo;But how are your teeth now?&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, much better. Nicolinka, my friend,&rdquo; he went on, and so feelingly that
      it sounded as though tears were standing in his eyes, &ldquo;I know and feel
      that I am bad, but God sees how I try to be better, and how I entreat Him
      to make me so. Yet what am I to do with such an unfortunate, horrible
      nature as mine? What am I to do with it? I try to keep myself in hand and
      to rule myself, but suddenly it becomes impossible for me to do so&mdash;at
      all events, impossible for me to do so unaided. I need the help and
      support of some one. Now, there is Lubov Sergievna; SHE understands me,
      and could help me in this, and I know by my notebook that I have greatly
      improved in this respect during the past year. Ah, my dear Nicolinka&rdquo;&mdash;he
      spoke with the most unusual and unwonted tenderness, and in a tone which
      had grown calmer now that he had made his confession&mdash;&ldquo;how much the
      influence of a woman like Lubov could do for me! Think how good it would
      be for me if I could have a friend like her to live with when I have
      become independent! With her I should be another man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And upon that Dimitri began to unfold to me his plans for marriage, for a
      life in the country, and for continual self-discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will live in the country,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you shall come to see me
      when you have married Sonetchka. Our children shall play together. All
      this may seem to you stupid and ridiculous, yet it may very well come to
      pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it very well may&rdquo; I replied with a smile, yet thinking how much
      nicer it would be if I married his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; he went on presently; &ldquo;you only imagine yourself to be
      in love with Sonetchka, whereas I can see that it is all rubbish, and that
      you do not really know what love means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not protest, for, in truth, I almost agreed with him, and for a
      while we lay without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably you have noticed that I have been in my old bad humour today,
      and have had a nasty quarrel with Varia?&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;I felt bad about it
      afterwards&mdash;more particularly since it occurred in your presence.
      Although she thinks wrongly on some subjects, she is a splendid girl and
      very good, as you will soon recognise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His quick transition from mention of my love affairs to praise of his
      sister pleased me extremely, and made me blush, but I nevertheless said
      nothing more about his sister, and we went on talking of other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we chattered until the cocks had crowed twice. In fact, the pale dawn
      was already looking in at the window when at last Dimitri lay down upon
      his bed and put out the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now for sleep,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now nice it is to be alive in the daylight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it IS a splendid thing!&rdquo; he replied in a voice which, even in the
      darkness, enabled me to see the expression of his cheerful, kindly eyes
      and boyish smile.

    <h2>
      XXVIII. IN THE COUNTRY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next day Woloda and myself departed in a post-chaise for the country.
      Turning over various Moscow recollections in my head as we drove along, I
      suddenly recalled Sonetchka Valakhin&mdash;though not until evening, and
      when we had already covered five stages of the road. &ldquo;It is a strange
      thing,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;that I should be in love, and yet have forgotten all
      about it. I must start and think about her,&rdquo; and straightway I proceeded
      to do so, but only in the way that one thinks when travelling&mdash;that
      is to say, disconnectedly, though vividly. Thus I brought myself to such a
      condition that, for the first two days after our arrival home, I somehow
      considered it incumbent upon me always to appear sad and moody in the
      presence of the household, and especially before Katenka, whom I looked
      upon as a great connoisseur in matters of this kind, and to whom I threw
      out a hint of the condition in which my heart was situated. Yet, for all
      my attempts at dissimulation and assiduous adoption of such signs of love
      sickness as I had occasionally observed in other people, I only succeeded
      for two days (and that at intervals, and mostly towards evening) in
      reminding myself of the fact that I was in love, and finally, when I had
      settled down into the new rut of country life and pursuits, I forgot about
      my affection for Sonetchka altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived at Petrovskoe in the night time, and I was then so soundly
      asleep that I saw nothing of the house as we approached it, nor yet of the
      avenue of birch trees, nor yet of the household&mdash;all of whom had long
      ago betaken themselves to bed and to slumber. Only old hunchbacked Foka&mdash;bare-footed,
      clad in some sort of a woman&rsquo;s wadded nightdress, and carrying a
      candlestick&mdash;opened the door to us. As soon as he saw who we were, he
      trembled all over with joy, kissed us on the shoulders, hurriedly put on
      his felt slippers, and started to dress himself properly. I passed in a
      semi-waking condition through the porch and up the steps, but in the hall
      the lock of the door, the bars and bolts, the crooked boards of the
      flooring, the chest, the ancient candelabrum (splashed all over with
      grease as of old), the shadows thrown by the crooked, chill,
      recently-lighted stump of candle, the perennially dusty, unopened window
      behind which I remembered sorrel to have grown&mdash;all was so familiar,
      so full of memories, so intimate of aspect, so, as it were, knit together
      by a single idea, that I suddenly became conscious of a tenderness for
      this quiet old house. Involuntarily I asked myself, &ldquo;How have we, the
      house and I, managed to remain apart so long?&rdquo; and, hurrying from spot to
      spot, ran to see if all the other rooms were still the same. Yes,
      everything was unchanged, except that everything had become smaller and
      lower, and I myself taller, heavier, and more filled out. Yet, even as I
      was, the old house received me back into its arms, and aroused in me with
      every board, every window, every step of the stairs, and every sound the
      shadows of forms, feelings, and events of the happy but irrevocable past.
      When we entered our old night nursery, all my childish fears lurked once
      more in the darkness of the corners and doorway. When we passed into the
      drawing-room, I could feel the old calm motherly love diffusing itself
      from every object in the apartment. In the breakfast-room, the noisy,
      careless merriment of childhood seemed merely to be waiting to wake to
      life again. In the divannaia (whither Foka first conducted us, and where
      he had prepared our beds) everything&mdash;mirror, screen, old wooden
      ikon, the lumps on the walls covered with white paper&mdash;seemed to
      speak of suffering and of death and of what would never come back to us
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got into bed, and Foka, bidding us good-night, retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in this room that Mamma died, was it not?&rdquo; said Woloda.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no reply, but pretended to be asleep. If I had said anything I
      should have burst into tears. On awaking next morning, I beheld Papa
      sitting on Woloda&rsquo;s bed in his dressing gown and slippers and smoking a
      cigar. Leaping up with a merry hoist of the shoulders, he came over to me,
      slapped me on the back with his great hand, and presented me his cheek to
      press my lips to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, DIPLOMAT!&rdquo; he said in his most kindly jesting tone as he
      looked at me with his small bright eyes. &ldquo;Woloda tells me you have passed
      the examinations well for a youngster, and that is a splendid thing.
      Unless you start and play the fool, I shall have another fine little
      fellow in you. Thanks, my dear boy. Well, we will have a grand time of it
      here now, and in the winter, perhaps, we shall move to St. Petersburg. I
      only wish the hunting was not over yet, or I could have given you some
      amusement in THAT way. Can you shoot, Woldemar? However, whether there is
      any game or not, I will take you out some day. Next winter, if God
      pleases, we will move to St. Petersburg, and you shall meet people, and
      make friends, for you are now my two young grown-ups. I have been telling
      Woldemar that you are just starting on your careers, whereas my day is
      ended. You are old enough now to walk by yourselves, but, whenever you
      wish to confide in me, pray do so, for I am no longer your nurse, but your
      friend. At least, I will be your friend and comrade and adviser as much as
      I can and more than that I cannot do. How does that fall in with your
      philosophy, eh, Koko? Well or ill, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I said that it fell in with it entirely, and, indeed, I really
      thought so. That morning Papa had a particularly winning, bright, and
      happy expression on his face, and these new relations between us, as of
      equals and comrades, made me love him all the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, tell me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;did you call upon all our kinsfolk and the
      Iwins? Did you see the old man, and what did he say to you? And did you go
      to Prince Ivan&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We continued talking so long that, before we were fully dressed, the sun
      had left the window of the divannaia, and Jakoff (the same old man who of
      yore had twirled his fingers behind his back and always repeated his
      words) had entered the room and reported to Papa that the carriage was
      ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo; I asked Papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I had forgotten all about it!&rdquo; he replied, with a cough and the usual
      hoisting of his shoulder. &ldquo;I promised to go and call upon Epifanova
      to-day. You remember Epifanova&mdash;&lsquo;la belle Flamande&rsquo;&mdash;don&rsquo;t you,
      who used to come and see your Mamma? They are nice people.&rdquo; And with a
      self-conscious shrug of his shoulders (so it appeared to me) Papa left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      During our conversation, Lubotshka had more than once come to the door and
      asked &ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo; but Papa had always shouted to her that she could
      not do so, since we were not dressed yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rubbish!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Why, I have seen you in your dressing-gown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; you cannot see your brothers without their inexpressibles,&rdquo;
       rejoined Papa. &ldquo;If they each of them just go to the door, let that be
      enough for you. Now go. Even for them to SPEAK to you in such a neglige
      costume is unbecoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unbearable you are!&rdquo; was Lubotshka&rsquo;s parting retort. &ldquo;Well, at least
      hurry up and come down to the drawing-room, for Mimi wants to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Papa had left the room, I hastened to array myself in my
      student&rsquo;s uniform, and to repair to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Woloda, on the other hand, was in no hurry, but remained sitting on his
      bed and talking to Jakoff about the best places to find plover and snipe.
      As I have said, there was nothing in the world he so much feared as to be
      suspected of any affection for his father, brother, and sister; so that,
      to escape any expression of that feeling, he often fell into the other
      extreme, and affected a coldness which shocked people who did not
      comprehend its cause. In the hall, I collided with Papa, who was hurrying
      towards the carriage with short, rapid steps. He had a new and fashionable
      Moscow greatcoat on, and smelt of scent. On seeing me, he gave a cheerful
      nod, as much as to say, &ldquo;Do you remark my splendour?&rdquo; and once again I was
      struck with the happy expression of face which I had noted earlier in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-room looked the same lofty, bright room as of Yore, with its
      brown English piano, and its large open windows looking on to the green
      trees and yellowish-red paths of the garden. After kissing Mimi and
      Lubotshka, I was approaching Katenka for the same purpose when it suddenly
      struck me that it might be improper for me to salute her in that fashion.
      Accordingly I halted, silent and blushing. Katenka, for her part, was
      quite at her ease as she held out a white hand to me and congratulated me
      on my passing into the University. The same thing took place when Woloda
      entered the drawing-room and met Katenka. Indeed, it was something of a
      problem how, after being brought up together and seeing one another daily,
      we ought now, after this first separation, to meet again. Katenka had
      grown better-looking than any of us, yet Woloda seemed not at all confused
      as, with a slight bow to her, he crossed over to Lubotshka, made a jesting
      remark to her, and then departed somewhere on some solitary expedition.

    <h2>
      XXIX. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GIRLS AND OURSELVES
    </h2>
    <p>
      OF the girls Woloda took the strange view that, although he wished that
      they should have enough to eat, should sleep well, be well dressed, and
      avoid making such mistakes in French as would shame him before strangers,
      he would never admit that they could think or feel like human beings,
      still less that they could converse with him sensibly about anything.
      Whenever they addressed to him a serious question (a thing, by the way,
      which he always tried to avoid), such as asking his opinion on a novel or
      inquiring about his doings at the University, he invariably pulled a
      grimace, and either turned away without speaking or answered with some
      nonsensical French phrase&mdash;&ldquo;Comme c&rsquo;est tres jolie!&rdquo; or the like. Or
      again, feigning to look serious and stolidly wise, he would say something
      absolutely meaningless and bearing no relation whatever to the question
      asked him, or else suddenly exclaim, with a look of pretended
      unconsciousness, the word bulku or poyechali or kapustu, [Respectively,
      &ldquo;roll of butter,&rdquo; &ldquo;away,&rdquo; and &ldquo;cabbage.&rdquo;] or something of the kind; and
      when, afterwards, I happened to repeat these words to him as having been
      told me by Lubotshka or Katenka, he would always remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! So you actually care about talking to them? I can see you are a
      duffer still&rdquo;&mdash;and one needed to see and near him to appreciate the
      profound, immutable contempt which echoed in this remark. He had been
      grown-up now two years, and was in love with every good-looking woman that
      he met; yet, despite the fact that he came in daily contact with Katenka
      (who during those two years had been wearing long dresses, and was growing
      prettier every day), the possibility of his falling in love with her never
      seemed to enter his head. Whether this proceeded from the fact that the
      prosaic recollections of childhood were still too fresh in his memory, or
      whether from the aversion which very young people feel for everything
      domestic, or whether from the common human weakness which, at a first
      encounter with anything fair and pretty, leads a man to say to himself,
      &ldquo;Ah! I shall meet much more of the same kind during my life,&rdquo; but at all
      events Woloda had never yet looked upon Katenka with a man&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that summer Woloda appeared to find things very wearisome&mdash;a fact
      which arose out of that contempt for us all which, as I have said, he made
      no effort to conceal. His expression of face seemed to be constantly
      saying, &ldquo;Phew! how it bores me to have no one to speak to!&rdquo; The first
      thing in the morning he would go out shooting, or sit reading a book in
      his room, and not dress until luncheon time. Indeed, if Papa was not at
      home, he would take his book into that meal, and go on reading it without
      addressing so much as a single word to any one of us, who felt, somehow,
      guilty in his presence. In the evening, too, he would stretch himself on a
      settee in the drawing-room, and either go to sleep, propped on his elbow,
      or tell us farcical stories&mdash;sometimes stories so improper as to make
      Mimi grow angry and blush, and ourselves die with laughter. At other times
      he would not condescend to address a single serious word to any member of
      the family except Papa or (occasionally) myself. Involuntarily I offended
      against his view of girls, seeing that I was not so afraid of seeming
      affectionate as he, and, moreover, had not such a profound and confirmed
      contempt for young women. Yet several times that summer, when driven by
      lack of amusement to try and engage Lubotshka and Katenka in conversation,
      I always encountered in them such an absence of any capacity for logical
      thinking, and such an ignorance of the simplest, most ordinary matters
      (as, for instance, the nature of money, the subjects studied at
      universities, the effect of war, and so forth), as well as such
      indifference to my explanations of such matters, that these attempts of
      mine only ended in confirming my unfavourable opinion of feminine ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember one evening when Lubotshka kept repeating some unbearably
      tedious passage on the piano about a hundred times in succession, while
      Woloda, who was dozing on a settee in the drawing-room, kept addressing no
      one in particular as he muttered, &ldquo;Lord! how she murders it! WHAT a
      musician! WHAT a Beethoven!&rdquo; (he always pronounced the composer&rsquo;s name
      with especial irony). &ldquo;Wrong again! Now&mdash;a second time! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;
       and so on. Meanwhile Katenka and I were sitting by the tea-table, and
      somehow she began to talk about her favourite subject&mdash;love. I was in
      the right frame of mind to philosophise, and began by loftily defining
      love as the wish to acquire in another what one does not possess in
      oneself. To this Katenka retorted that, on the contrary, love is not love
      at all if a girl desires to marry a man for his money alone, but that, in
      her opinion, riches were a vain thing, and true love only the affection
      which can stand the test of separation (this I took to be a hint
      concerning her love for Dubkoff). At this point Woloda, who must have been
      listening all the time, raised himself on his elbow, and cried out some
      rubbish or another; and I felt that he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the general faculties (more or less developed in different
      persons) of intellect, sensibility, and artistic feeling, there also
      exists (more or less developed in different circles of society, and
      especially in families) a private or individual faculty which I may call
      APPREHENSION. The essence of this faculty lies in sympathetic appreciation
      of proportion, and in identical understanding of things. Two individuals
      who possess this faculty and belong to the same social circle or the same
      family apprehend an expression of feeling precisely to the same point,
      namely, the point beyond which such expression becomes mere phrasing. Thus
      they apprehend precisely where commendation ends and irony begins, where
      attraction ends and pretence begins, in a manner which would be impossible
      for persons possessed of a different order of apprehension. Persons
      possessed of identical apprehension view objects in an identically
      ludicrous, beautiful, or repellent light; and in order to facilitate such
      identical apprehension between members of the same social circle or
      family, they usually establish a language, turns of speech, or terms to
      define such shades of apprehension as exist for them alone. In our
      particular family such apprehension was common to Papa, Woloda, and
      myself, and was developed to the highest pitch, Dubkoff also approximated
      to our coterie in apprehension, but Dimitri, though infinitely more
      intellectual than Dubkoff, was grosser in this respect. With no one,
      however, did I bring this faculty to such a point as with Woloda, who had
      grown up with me under identical conditions. Papa stood a long way from
      us, and much that was to us as clear as &ldquo;two and two make four&rdquo; was to him
      incomprehensible. For instance, I and Woloda managed to establish between
      ourselves the following terms, with meanings to correspond. Izium
      [Raisins.] meant a desire to boast of one&rsquo;s money; shishka [Bump or
      swelling.] (on pronouncing which one had to join one&rsquo;s fingers together,
      and to put a particular emphasis upon the two sh&rsquo;s in the word) meant
      anything fresh, healthy, and comely, but not elegant; a substantive used
      in the plural meant an undue partiality for the object which it denoted;
      and so forth, and so forth. At the same time, the meaning depended
      considerably upon the expression of the face and the context of the
      conversation; so that, no matter what new expression one of us might
      invent to define a shade of feeling the other could immediately understand
      it by a hint alone. The girls did not share this faculty of apprehension,
      and herein lay the chief cause of our moral estrangement, and of the
      contempt which we felt for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be that they too had their &ldquo;apprehension,&rdquo; but it so little ran
      with ours that, where we already perceived the &ldquo;phrasing,&rdquo; they still saw
      only the feeling&mdash;our irony was for them truth, and so on. At that
      time I had not yet learnt to understand that they were in no way to blame
      for this, and that absence of such apprehension in no way prevented them
      from being good and clever girls. Accordingly I looked down upon them.
      Moreover, having once lit upon my precious idea of &ldquo;frankness,&rdquo; and being
      bent upon applying it to the full in myself, I thought the quiet,
      confiding nature of Lubotshka guilty of secretiveness and dissimulation
      simply because she saw no necessity for digging up and examining all her
      thoughts and instincts. For instance, the fact that she always signed the
      sign of the cross over Papa before going to bed, that she and Katenka
      invariably wept in church when attending requiem masses for Mamma, and
      that Katenka sighed and rolled her eyes about when playing the piano&mdash;all
      these things seemed to me sheer make-believe, and I asked myself: &ldquo;At what
      period did they learn to pretend like grown-up people, and how can they
      bring themselves to do it?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXX. HOW I EMPLOYED MY TIME
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the fact that that summer I developed a passion for music
      caused me to become better friends with the ladies of our household than I
      had been for years. In the spring, a young fellow came to see us, armed
      with a letter of introduction, who, as soon as ever he entered the
      drawing-room, fixed his eyes upon the piano, and kept gradually edging his
      chair closer to it as he talked to Mimi and Katenka. After discoursing
      awhile of the weather and the amenities of country life, he skilfully
      directed the conversation to piano-tuners, music, and pianos generally,
      and ended by saying that he himself played&mdash;and in truth he did sit
      down and perform three waltzes, with Mimi, Lubotshka, and Katenka grouped
      about the instrument, and watching him as he did so. He never came to see
      us again, but his playing, and his attitude when at the piano, and the way
      in which he kept shaking his long hair, and, most of all, the manner in
      which he was able to execute octaves with his left hand as he first of all
      played them rapidly with his thumb and little finger, and then slowly
      closed those members, and then played the octaves afresh, made a great
      impression upon me. This graceful gesture of his, together with his easy
      pose and his shaking of hair and successful winning of the ladies&rsquo; 
      applause by his talent, ended by firing me to take up the piano. Convinced
      that I possessed both talent and a passion for music, I set myself to
      learn, and, in doing so, acted just as millions of the male&mdash;still
      more, of the female&mdash;sex have done who try to teach themselves
      without a skilled instructor, without any real turn for the art, or
      without the smallest understanding either of what the art can give or of
      what ought to be done to obtain that gift. For me music (or rather,
      piano-playing) was simply a means of winning the ladies&rsquo; good graces
      through their sensibility. With the help of Katenka I first learnt the
      notes (incidentally breaking several of them with my clumsy fingers), and
      then&mdash;that is to say, after two months of hard work, supplemented by
      ceaseless twiddling of my rebellious fingers on my knees after luncheon,
      and on the pillow when in bed&mdash;went on to &ldquo;pieces,&rdquo; which I played
      (so Katenka assured me) with &ldquo;soul&rdquo; (&ldquo;avec ame&rdquo;), but altogether
      regardless of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      My range of pieces was the usual one&mdash;waltzes, galops, &ldquo;romances,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;arrangements,&rdquo; etcetera; all of them of the class of delightful
      compositions of which any one with a little healthy taste could point out
      a selection among the better class works contained in any volume of music
      and say, &ldquo;These are what you ought NOT to play, seeing that anything
      worse, less tasteful, and more silly has never yet been included in any
      collection of music,&rdquo;&mdash;but which (probably for that very reason) are
      to be found on the piano of every Russian lady. True, we also possessed an
      unfortunate volume which contained Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sonate Pathetique&rdquo; and the
      C minor Sonata (a volume lamed for life by the ladies&mdash;more
      especially by Lubotshka, who used to discourse music from it in memory of
      Mamma), as well as certain other good pieces which her teacher in Moscow
      had given her; but among that collection there were likewise compositions
      of the teacher&rsquo;s own, in the shape of clumsy marches and galops&mdash;and
      these too Lubotshka used to play! Katenka and I cared nothing for serious
      works, but preferred, above all things, &ldquo;Le Fou&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Nightingale&rdquo;&mdash;the
      latter of which Katenka would play until her fingers almost became
      invisible, and which I too was beginning to execute with much vigour and
      some continuity. I had adopted the gestures of the young man of whom I
      have spoken, and frequently regretted that there were no strangers present
      to see me play. Soon, however, I began to realise that Liszt and
      Kalkbrenner were beyond me, and that I should never overtake Katenka.
      Accordingly, imagining that classical music was easier (as well as,
      partly, for the sake of originality), I suddenly came to the conclusion
      that I loved abstruse German music. I began to go into raptures whenever
      Lubotshka played the &ldquo;Sonate Pathetique,&rdquo; and although (if the truth be
      told) that work had for years driven me to the verge of distraction, I set
      myself to play Beethoven, and to talk of him as &ldquo;Beethoven.&rdquo; Yet through
      all this chopping and changing and pretence (as I now conceive) there may
      have run in me a certain vein of talent, since music sometimes affected me
      even to tears, and things which particularly pleased me I could strum on
      the piano afterwards (in a certain fashion) without the score; so that,
      had any one taught me at that period to look upon music as an end, a
      grace, in itself, and not merely as a means for pleasing womenfolk with
      the velocity and pseudo-sentiment of one&rsquo;s playing, I might possibly have
      become a passable musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading of French novels (of which Woloda had brought a large store
      with him from Moscow) was another of my amusements that summer. At that
      period Monte Cristo and Taine&rsquo;s works had just appeared, while I also
      revelled in stories by Sue, Dumas, and Paul de Kock. Even their most
      unnatural personages and events were for me as real as actuality, and not
      only was I incapable of suspecting an author of lying, but, in my eyes,
      there existed no author at all. That is to say, the various personages and
      events of a book paraded themselves before me on the printed page as
      personages and events that were alive and real; and although I had never
      in my life met such characters as I there read about, I never for a second
      doubted that I should one day do so. I discovered in myself all the
      passions described in every novel, as well as a likeness to all the
      characters&mdash;heroes and villains impartially&mdash;who figured
      therein, just as a suspicious man finds in himself the signs of every
      possible disease when reading a book on medicine. I took pleasure both in
      the cunning designs, the glowing sentiments, the tumultuous events, and
      the character-drawing of these works. A good man was of the goodness, a
      bad man of the badness, possible only to the imagination of early youth.
      Likewise I found great pleasure in the fact that it was all written in
      French, and that I could lay to heart the fine words which the fine heroes
      spoke, and recall them for use some day when engaged in some noble deed.
      What quantities of French phrases I culled from those books for
      Kolpikoff&rsquo;s benefit if I should ever meet him again, as well as for HERS,
      when at length I should find her and reveal to her my love! For them both
      I prepared speeches which should overcome them as soon as spoken! Upon
      novels, too, I founded new ideals of the moral qualities which I wished to
      attain. First of all, I wished to be NOBLE in all my deeds and conduct (I
      use the French word noble instead of the Russian word blagorodni for the
      reason that the former has a different meaning to the latter&mdash;as the
      Germans well understood when they adopted noble as nobel and
      differentiated it from ehrlich); next, to be strenuous; and lastly, to be
      what I was already inclined to be, namely, comme il faut. I even tried to
      approximate my appearance and bearing to that of the heroes who possessed
      these qualities. In particular I remember how in one of the hundred or so
      novels which I read that summer there was a very strenuous hero with heavy
      eyebrows, and that I so greatly wished to resemble him (I felt that I did
      so already from a moral point of view) that one day, when looking at my
      eyebrows in the glass, I conceived the idea of clipping them, in order to
      make them grow bushier. Unfortunately, after I had started to do so, I
      happened to clip one spot rather shorter than the rest, and so had to
      level down the rest to it-with the result that, to my horror, I beheld
      myself eyebrow-less, and anything but presentable. However, I comforted
      myself with the reflection that my eyebrows would soon sprout again as
      bushy as my hero&rsquo;s, and was only perplexed to think how I could explain
      the circumstance to the household when they next perceived my eyebrow-less
      condition. Accordingly I borrowed some gunpowder from Woloda, rubbed it on
      my temples, and set it alight. The powder did not fire properly, but I
      succeeded in singeing myself sufficiently to avert all suspicion of my
      pranks. And, indeed, afterwards, when I had forgotten all about my hero,
      my eyebrows grew again, and much thicker than they had been before.

    <h2>
      XXXI. &ldquo;COMME IL FAUT&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      SEVERAL times in the course of this narrative I have hinted at an idea
      corresponding to the above French heading, and now feel it incumbent upon
      me to devote a whole chapter to that idea, which was one of the most
      ruinous, lying notions which ever became engrafted upon my life by my
      upbringing and social milieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The human race may be divided into several categories&mdash;rich and poor,
      good and bad, military and civilian, clever and stupid, and so forth, and
      so forth. Yet each man has his own favourite, fundamental system of
      division which he unconsciously uses to class each new person with whom he
      meets. At the time of which I am speaking, my own favourite, fundamental
      system of division in this respect was into people &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo; and
      people &ldquo;comme il ne faut pas&rdquo;&mdash;the latter subdivided, again, into
      people merely not &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo; and the lower orders. People &ldquo;comme il
      faut&rdquo; I respected, and looked upon as worthy to consort with me as my
      equals; the second of the above categories I pretended merely to despise,
      but in reality hated, and nourished towards them a kind of feeling of
      offended personality; while the third category had no existence at all, so
      far as I was concerned, since my contempt for them was too complete. This
      &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo;-ness of mine lay, first and foremost, in proficiency in
      French, especially conversational French. A person who spoke that language
      badly at once aroused in me a feeling of dislike. &ldquo;Why do you try to talk
      as we do when you haven&rsquo;t a notion how to do it?&rdquo; I would seem to ask him
      with my most venomous and quizzing smile. The second condition of &ldquo;comme
      il faut&rdquo;-ness was long nails that were well kept and clean; the third,
      ability to bow, dance, and converse; the fourth&mdash;and a very important
      one&mdash;indifference to everything, and a constant air of refined,
      supercilious ennui. Moreover, there were certain general signs which, I
      considered, enabled me to tell, without actually speaking to a man, the
      class to which he belonged. Chief among these signs (the others being the
      fittings of his rooms, his gloves, his handwriting, his turn-out, and so
      forth) were his feet. The relation of boots to trousers was sufficient to
      determine, in my eyes, the social status of a man. Heelless boots with
      angular toes, wedded to narrow, unstrapped trouser-ends&mdash;these
      denoted the vulgarian. Boots with narrow, round toes and heels,
      accompanied either by tight trousers strapped under the instep and fitting
      close to the leg or by wide trousers similarly strapped, but projecting in
      a peak over the toe&mdash;these meant the man of mauvais genre; and so on,
      and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious thing that I who lacked all ability to become &ldquo;comme il
      faut,&rdquo; should have assimilated the idea so completely as I did. Possibly
      it was the fact that it had cost me such enormous labour to acquire that
      brought about its strenuous development in my mind. I hardly like to think
      how much of the best and most valuable time of my first sixteen years of
      existence I wasted upon its acquisition. Yet every one whom I imitated&mdash;Woloda,
      Dubkoff, and the majority of my acquaintances&mdash;seemed to acquire it
      easily. I watched them with envy, and silently toiled to become proficient
      in French, to bow gracefully and without looking at the person whom I was
      saluting, to gain dexterity in small-talk and dancing, to cultivate
      indifference and ennui, and to keep my fingernails well trimmed (though I
      frequently cut my finger-ends with the scissors in so doing). And all the
      time I felt that so much remained to be done if I was ever to attain my
      end! A room, a writing-table, an equipage I still found it impossible to
      arrange &ldquo;comme il faut,&rdquo; however much I fought down my aversion to
      practical matters in my desire to become proficient. Yet everything seemed
      to arrange itself properly with other people, just as though things could
      never have been otherwise! Once I remember asking Dubkoff, after much
      zealous and careful labouring at my finger-nails (his own were
      extraordinarily good), whether his nails had always been as now, or
      whether he had done anything to make them so: to which he replied that
      never within his recollection had he done anything to them, and that he
      could not imagine a gentleman&rsquo;s nails possibly being different. This
      answer incensed me greatly, for I had not yet learnt that one of the chief
      conditions of &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo;-ness was to hold one&rsquo;s tongue about the
      labour by which it had been acquired. &ldquo;Comme il faut&rdquo;-ness I looked upon
      as not only a great merit, a splendid accomplishment, an embodiment of all
      the perfection which must strive to attain, but as the one indispensable
      condition without which there could never be happiness, nor glory, nor any
      good whatsoever in this world. Even the greatest artist or savant or
      benefactor of the human race would at that time have won from me no
      respect if he had not also been &ldquo;comme il faut.&rdquo; A man possessed of &ldquo;comme
      il faut&rdquo;-ness stood higher than, and beyond all possible equality with,
      such people, and might well leave it to them to paint pictures, to compose
      music, to write books, or to do good. Possibly he might commend them for
      so doing (since why should not merit be commended where-ever it be
      found?), but he could never stand ON A LEVEL with them, seeing that he was
      &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo; and they were not&mdash;a quite final and sufficient
      reason. In fact, I actually believe that, had we possessed a brother or a
      father or a mother who had not been &ldquo;comme il faut,&rdquo; I should have
      declared it to be a great misfortune for us, and announced that between
      myself and them there could never be anything in common. Yet neither waste
      of the golden hours which I consumed in constantly endeavouring to observe
      the many arduous, unattainable conditions of &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo;-ness (to the
      exclusion of any more serious pursuit), nor dislike of and contempt for
      nine-tenths of the human race, nor disregard of all the beauty that lay
      outside the narrow circle of &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo;-ness comprised the whole of
      the evil which the idea wrought in me. The chief evil of all lay in the
      notion acquired that a man need not strive to become a tchinovnik,
      [Official.] a coachbuilder, a soldier, a savant, or anything useful, so
      long only as he was &ldquo;comme il faut &ldquo;&mdash;that by attaining the latter
      quality he had done all that was demanded of him, and was even superior to
      most people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, at a given period in youth, and after many errors and excesses,
      every man recognises the necessity of his taking an active part in social
      life, and chooses some branch of labour to which to devote himself. Only
      with the &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo; man does this rarely happen. I have known, and
      know, very, very many people&mdash;old, proud, self-satisfied, and
      opinionated&mdash;who to the question (if it should ever present itself to
      them in their world) &ldquo;Who have you been, and what have you ever done?&rdquo;
       would be unable to reply otherwise than by saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Je fus un homme tres comme il faut,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such a fate was awaiting myself.

    <h2>
      XXXII. YOUTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Despite the confusion of ideas raging in my head, I was at least young,
      innocent, and free that summer&mdash;consequently almost happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I would rise quite early in the morning, for I slept on the open
      verandah, and the bright, horizontal beams of the morning sun would wake
      me up. Dressing myself quickly, I would tuck a towel and a French novel
      under my arm, and go off to bathe in the river in the shade of a birch
      tree which stood half a verst from the house. Next, I would stretch myself
      on the grass and read&mdash;raising my eyes from time to time to look at
      the surface of the river where it showed blue in the shade of the trees,
      at the ripples caused by the first morning breeze, at the yellowing field
      of rye on the further bank, and at the bright-red sheen of the sunlight as
      it struck lower and lower down the white trunks of the birch-trees which,
      ranged in ranks one behind the other, gradually receded into the remote
      distance of the home park. At such moments I would feel joyously conscious
      of having within me the same young, fresh force of life as nature was
      everywhere exuding around me. When, however, the sky was overcast with
      grey clouds of morning and I felt chilly after bathing, I would often
      start to walk at random through the fields and woods, and joyously trail
      my wet boots in the fresh dew. All the while my head would be filled with
      vivid dreams concerning the heroes of my last-read novel, and I would keep
      picturing to myself some leader of an army or some statesman or
      marvellously strong man or devoted lover or another, and looking round me
      in, a nervous expectation that I should suddenly descry HER somewhere near
      me, in a meadow or behind a tree. Yet, whenever these rambles led me near
      peasants engaged at their work, all my ignoring of the existence of the
      &ldquo;common people&rdquo; did not prevent me from experiencing an involuntary,
      overpowering sensation of awkwardness; so that I always tried to avoid
      their seeing me. When the heat of the day had increased, it was not
      infrequently my habit&mdash;if the ladies did not come out of doors for
      their morning tea&mdash;to go rambling through the orchard and
      kitchen-garden, and to pluck ripe fruit there. Indeed, this was an
      occupation which furnished me with one of my greatest pleasures. Let any
      one go into an orchard, and dive into the midst of a tall, thick,
      sprouting raspberry-bed. Above will be seen the clear, glowing sky, and,
      all around, the pale-green, prickly stems of raspberry-trees where they
      grow mingled together in a tangle of profusion. At one&rsquo;s feet springs the
      dark-green nettle, with its slender crown of flowers, while the
      broad-leaved burdock, with its bright-pink, prickly blossoms, overtops the
      raspberries (and even one&rsquo;s head) with its luxuriant masses, until, with
      the nettle, it almost meets the pendent, pale-green branches of the old
      apple-trees where apples, round and lustrous as bone, but as yet unripe,
      are mellowing in the heat of the sun. Below, again, are seen young
      raspberry-shoots, twining themselves around the partially withered,
      leafless parent plant, and stretching their tendrils towards the sunlight,
      with green, needle-shaped blades of grass and young, dew-coated pods
      peering through last year&rsquo;s leaves, and growing juicily green in the
      perennial shade, as though they care nothing for the bright sunshine which
      is playing on the leaves of the apple-trees above them. In this density
      there is always moisture&mdash;always a smell of confined, perpetual
      shade, of cobwebs, fallen apples (turning black where they roll on the
      mouldy sod), raspberries, and earwigs of the kind which impel one to reach
      hastily for more fruit when one has inadvertently swallowed a member of
      that insect tribe with the last berry. At every step one&rsquo;s movements keep
      flushing the sparrows which always make their home in these depths, and
      one hears their fussy chirping and the beating of their tiny, fluttering
      wings against the stalks, and catches the low buzzing of a bumble bee
      somewhere, and the sound of the gardener&rsquo;s footsteps (it is half-daft
      Akim) on the path as he hums his eternal sing-song to himself. Then one
      mutters under one&rsquo;s breath, &ldquo;No! Neither he nor any one else shall find me
      here!&rdquo; yet still one goes on stripping juicy berries from their conical
      white pilasters, and cramming them into one&rsquo;s mouth. At length, one&rsquo;s legs
      soaked to the knees as one repeats, over and over again, some rubbish
      which keeps running in one&rsquo;s head, and one&rsquo;s hands and nether limbs
      (despite the protection of one&rsquo;s wet trousers) thoroughly stung with the
      nettles, one comes to the conclusion that the sun&rsquo;s rays are beating too
      straight upon one&rsquo;s head for eating to be any longer desirable, and,
      sinking down into the tangle of greenery, one remains there&mdash;looking
      and listening, and continuing in mechanical fashion to strip off one or
      two of the finer berries and swallow them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;that is to say, when the ladies had taken their
      morning tea and settled down to their occupations&mdash;I would repair to
      the drawing-room. Near the first window, with its unbleached linen blind
      lowered to exclude the sunshine, but through the chink of which the sun
      kept throwing brilliant circles of light which hurt the eye to look at
      them, there would be standing a screen, with flies quietly parading the
      whiteness of its covering. Behind it would be seated Mimi, shaking her
      head in an irritable manner, and constantly shifting from spot to spot to
      avoid the sunshine as at intervals it darted her from somewhere and laid a
      streak of flame upon her hand or face. Through the other three windows the
      sun would be throwing three squares of light, crossed with the shadows of
      the window-frames, and where one of these patches marked the unstained
      floor of the room there would be lying, in accordance with invariable
      custom, Milka, with her ears pricked as she watched the flies promenading
      the lighted space. Seated on a settee, Katenka would be knitting or
      reading aloud as from time to time she gave her white sleeves (looking
      almost transparent in the sunshine) an impatient shake, or tossed her head
      with a frown to drive away some fly which had settled upon her thick
      auburn hair and was now buzzing in its tangles. Lubotshka would either be
      walking up and down the room (her hands clasped behind her) until the
      moment should arrive when a movement would be made towards the garden, or
      playing some piece of which every note had long been familiar to me. For
      my own part, I would sit down somewhere, and listen to the music or the
      reading until such time as I myself should have an opportunity of
      performing on the piano. After luncheon I would condescend to take the
      girls out riding (since to go for a mere walk at that hour seemed to me
      unsuitable to my years and position in the world), and these excursions of
      ours&mdash;in which I often took my companions through unaccustomed spots
      and dells&mdash;were very pleasant. Indeed, on some of these occasions I
      grew quite boyish, and the girls would praise my riding and daring, and
      pretend that I was their protector. In the evening, if we had no guests
      with us, tea (served in the dim verandah), would be followed by a walk
      round the homestead with Papa, and then I would stretch myself on my usual
      settee, and read and ponder as of old, as I listened to Katenka or
      Lubotshka playing. At other times, if I was alone in the drawing-room and
      Lubotshka was performing some old-time air, I would find myself laying my
      book down, and gazing through the open doorway on to the balcony at the
      pendent, sinuous branches of the tall birch-trees where they stood
      overshadowed by the coming night, and at the clear sky where, if one
      looked at it intently enough, misty, yellowish spots would appear
      suddenly, and then disappear again. Next, as I listened to the sounds of
      the music wafted from the salon, and to the creaking of gates and the
      voices of the peasant women when the cattle returned to the village, I
      would suddenly bethink me of Natalia Savishna and of Mamma and of Karl
      Ivanitch, and become momentarily sad. But in those days my spirit was so
      full of life and hope that such reminiscences only touched me in passing,
      and soon fled away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper and (sometimes) a night stroll with some one in the garden
      (for I was afraid to walk down the dark avenues by myself), I would repair
      to my solitary sleeping-place on the verandah&mdash;a proceeding which,
      despite the countless mosquitos which always devoured me, afforded me the
      greatest pleasure. If the moon was full, I frequently spent whole nights
      sitting up on my mattress, looking at the light and shade, listening to
      the sounds or stillness, dreaming of one matter and another (but more
      particularly of the poetic, voluptuous happiness which, in those days, I
      believed was to prove the acme of my felicity) and lamenting that until
      now it had only been given to me to IMAGINE things. No sooner had every
      one dispersed, and I had seen lights pass from the drawing-room to the
      upper chambers (whence female voices would presently be heard, and the
      noise of windows opening and shutting), than I would depart to the
      verandah, and walk up and down there as I listened attentively to the
      sounds from the slumbering mansion. To this day, whenever I feel any
      expectation (no matter how small and baseless) of realising a fraction of
      some happiness of which I may be dreaming, I somehow invariably fail to
      picture to myself what the imagined happiness is going to be like.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the least sound of bare footsteps, or of a cough, or of a snore, or of
      the rattling of a window, or of the rustling of a dress, I would leap from
      my mattress, and stand furtively gazing and listening, thrown, without any
      visible cause, into extreme agitation. But the lights would disappear from
      the upper rooms, the sounds of footsteps and talking give place to snores,
      the watchman begin his nightly tapping with his stick, the garden grow
      brighter and more mysterious as the streaks of light vanished from the
      windows, the last candle pass from the pantry to the hall (throwing a
      glimmer into the dewy garden as it did so), and the stooping figure of
      Foka (decked in a nightcap, and carrying the candle) become visible to my
      eyes as he went to his bed. Often I would find a great and fearful
      pleasure in stealing over the grass, in the black shadow of the house,
      until I had reached the hall window, where I would stand listening with
      bated breath to the snoring of the boy, to Foka&rsquo;s gruntings (in the belief
      that no one heard him), and to the sound of his senile voice as he drawled
      out the evening prayers. At length even his candle would be extinguished,
      and the window slammed down, so that I would find myself utterly alone;
      whereupon, glancing nervously from side to side, lest haply I should see
      the white woman standing near a flower-bed or by my couch, I would run at
      full speed back to the verandah. Then, and only then, I would lie down
      with my face to the garden, and, covering myself over, so far as possible,
      from the mosquitos and bats, fall to gazing in front of me as I listened
      to the sounds of the night and dreamed of love and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At such times everything would take on for me a different meaning. The
      look of the old birch trees, with the one side of their curling branches
      showing bright against the moonlit sky, and the other darkening the bushes
      and carriage-drive with their black shadows; the calm, rich glitter of the
      pond, ever swelling like a sound; the moonlit sparkle of the dewdrops on
      the flowers in front of the verandah; the graceful shadows of those
      flowers where they lay thrown upon the grey stonework; the cry of a quail
      on the far side of the pond; the voice of some one walking on the high
      road; the quiet, scarcely audible scrunching of two old birch trees
      against one another; the humming of a mosquito at my car under the
      coverlet; the fall of an apple as it caught against a branch and rustled
      among the dry leaves; the leapings of frogs as they approached almost to
      the verandah-steps and sat with the moon shining mysteriously on their
      green backs&mdash;all these things took on for me a strange significance&mdash;a
      significance of exceeding beauty and of infinite love. Before me would
      rise SHE, with long black tresses and a high bust, but always mournful in
      her fairness, with bare hands and voluptuous arms. She loved me, and for
      one moment of her love I would sacrifice my whole life!&mdash;But the moon
      would go on rising higher and higher, and shining brighter and brighter,
      in the heavens; the rich sparkle of the pond would swell like a sound, and
      become ever more and more brilliant, while the shadows would grow blacker
      and blacker, and the sheen of the moon more and more transparent: until,
      as I looked at and listened to all this, something would say to me that
      SHE with the bare hands and voluptuous arms did not represent ALL
      happiness, that love for her did not represent ALL good; so that, the more
      I gazed at the full, high-riding moon, the higher would true beauty and
      goodness appear to me to lie, and the purer and purer they would seem&mdash;the
      nearer and nearer to Him who is the source of all beauty and all goodness.
      And tears of a sort of unsatisfied, yet tumultuous, joy would fill my
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always, too, I was alone; yet always, too, it seemed to me that, although
      great, mysterious Nature could draw the shining disc of the moon to
      herself, and somehow hold in some high, indefinite place the pale-blue
      sky, and be everywhere around me, and fill of herself the infinity of
      space, while I was but a lowly worm, already defiled with the poor, petty
      passions of humanity&mdash;always it seemed to me that, nevertheless, both
      Nature and the moon and I were one.

    <h2>
      XXXIII. OUR NEIGHBOURS
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the first day after our arrival, I had been greatly astonished that
      Papa should speak of our neighbours, the Epifanovs, as &ldquo;nice people,&rdquo; and
      still more so that he should go to call upon them. The fact was that we
      had long been at law over some land with this family. When a child, I had
      more than once heard Papa raging over the litigation, abusing the
      Epifanovs, and warning people (so I understood him) against them.
      Likewise, I had heard Jakoff speak of them as &ldquo;our enemies&rdquo; and &ldquo;black
      people&rdquo; and could remember Mamma requesting that their names should never
      be mentioned in her presence, nor, indeed, in the house at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these data I, as a child, had arrived at the clear and assured
      conviction that the Epifanovs were foemen of ours who would at any time
      stab or strangle both Papa and his sons if they should ever come across
      them, as well as that they were &ldquo;black people&rdquo;, in the literal sense of
      the term. Consequently, when, in the year that Mamma died, I chanced to
      catch sight of Avdotia (&ldquo;La Belle Flamande&rdquo;) on the occasion of a visit
      which she paid to my mother, I found it hard to believe that she did not
      come of a family of negroes. All the same, I had the lowest possible
      opinion of the family, and, for all that we saw much of them that summer,
      continued to be strongly prejudiced against them. As a matter of fact,
      their household only consisted of the mother (a widow of fifty, but a very
      well-preserved, cheery old woman), a beautiful daughter named Avdotia, and
      a son, Peter, who was a stammerer, unmarried, and of very serious
      disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last twenty years before her husband&rsquo;s death, Madame Epifanov had
      lived apart from him&mdash;sometimes in St. Petersburg, where she had
      relatives, but more frequently at her village of Mitishtchi, which stood
      some three versts from ours. Yet the neighbourhood had taken to
      circulating such horrible tales concerning her mode of life that Messalina
      was, by comparison, a blameless child: which was why my mother had
      requested her name never to be mentioned. As a matter of fact, not
      one-tenth part of the most cruel of all gossip&mdash;the gossip of
      country-houses&mdash;is worthy of credence; and although, when I first
      made Madame&rsquo;s acquaintance, she had living with her in the house a clerk
      named Mitusha, who had been promoted from a serf, and who, curled,
      pomaded, and dressed in a frockcoat of Circassian pattern, always stood
      behind his mistress&rsquo;s chair at luncheon, while from time to time she
      invited her guests to admire his handsome eyes and mouth, there was
      nothing for gossip to take hold of. I believe, too, that since the time&mdash;ten
      years earlier&mdash;when she had recalled her dutiful son Peter from the
      service, she had wholly changed her mode of living. It seems her property
      had never been a large one&mdash;merely a hundred souls or so&mdash;[This
      refers, of course, to the days of serfdom.]and that during her previous
      life of gaiety she had spent a great deal. Consequently, when, some ten
      years ago, those portions of the property which had been mortgaged and
      re-mortgaged had been foreclosed upon and compulsorily sold by auction,
      she had come to the conclusion that all these unpleasant details of
      distress upon and valuation of her property had been due not so much to
      failure to pay the interest as to the fact that she was a woman: wherefore
      she had written to her son (then serving with his regiment) to come and
      save his mother from her embarrassments, and he, like a dutiful son&mdash;conceiving
      that his first duty was to comfort his mother in her old age&mdash;had
      straightway resigned his commission (for all that he had been doing well
      in his profession, and was hoping soon to become independent), and had
      come to join her in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite his plain face, uncouth demeanour, and fault of stuttering, Peter
      was a man of unswerving principles and of the most extraordinary good
      sense. Somehow&mdash;by small borrowings, sundry strokes of business,
      petitions for grace, and promises to repay&mdash;he contrived to carry on
      the property, and, making himself overseer, donned his father&rsquo;s greatcoat
      (still preserved in a drawer), dispensed with horses and carriages,
      discouraged guests from calling at Mitishtchi, fashioned his own sleighs,
      increased his arable land and curtailed that of the serfs, felled his own
      timber, sold his produce in person, and saw to matters generally. Indeed,
      he swore, and kept his oath, that, until all outstanding debts were paid,
      he would never wear any clothes than his father&rsquo;s greatcoat and a corduroy
      jacket which he had made for himself, nor yet ride in aught but a country
      waggon, drawn by peasants&rsquo; horses. This stoical mode of life he sought to
      apply also to his family, so far as the sympathetic respect which he
      conceived to be his mother&rsquo;s due would allow of; so that, although, in the
      drawing-room, he would show her only stuttering servility, and fulfil all
      her wishes, and blame any one who did not do precisely as she bid them, in
      his study or his office he would overhaul the cook if she had served up so
      much as a duck without his orders, or any one responsible for sending a
      serf (even though at Madame&rsquo;s own bidding) to inquire after a neighbour&rsquo;s
      health or for despatching the peasant girls into the wood to gather wild
      raspberries instead of setting them to weed the kitchen-garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within four years every debt had been repaid, and Peter had gone to Moscow
      and returned thence in a new jacket and tarantass. [A two-wheeled
      carriage.] Yet, despite this flourishing position of affairs, he still
      preserved the stoical tendencies in which, to tell the truth, he took a
      certain vague pride before his family and strangers, since he would
      frequently say with a stutter: &ldquo;Any one who REALLY wishes to see me will
      be glad to see me even in my dressing-gown, and to eat nothing but shtchi
      [Cabbage-soup.] and kasha [Buckwheat gruel.] at my table.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is what I
      eat myself,&rdquo; he would add. In his every word and movement spoke pride
      based upon a consciousness of having sacrificed himself for his mother and
      redeemed the property, as well as contempt for any one who had not done
      something of the same kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother and daughter were altogether different characters from Peter,
      as well as altogether different from one another. The former was one of
      the most agreeable, uniformly good-tempered, and cheerful women whom one
      could possibly meet. Anything attractive and genuinely happy delighted
      her. Even the faculty of being pleased with the sight of young people
      enjoying themselves (it is only in the best-natured of elderly folk that
      one meets with that TRAIT) she possessed to the full. On the other hand,
      her daughter was of a grave turn of mind. Rather, she was of that
      peculiarly careless, absent-minded, gratuitously distant bearing which
      commonly distinguishes unmarried beauties. Whenever she tried to be gay,
      her gaiety somehow seemed to be unnatural to her, so that she always
      appeared to be laughing either at herself or at the persons to whom she
      was speaking or at the world in general&mdash;a thing which, possibly, she
      had no real intention of doing. Often I asked myself in astonishment what
      she could mean when she said something like, &ldquo;Yes, I know how terribly
      good-looking I am,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Of course every one is in love with me,&rdquo; and so
      forth. Her mother was a person always busy, since she had a passion for
      housekeeping, gardening, flowers, canaries, and pretty trinkets. Her rooms
      and garden, it is true, were small and poorly fitted-up, yet everything in
      them was so neat and methodical, and bore such a general air of that
      gentle gaiety which one hears expressed in a waltz or polka, that the word
      &ldquo;toy&rdquo; by which guests often expressed their praise of it all exactly
      suited her surroundings. She herself was a &ldquo;toy&rdquo;&mdash;being petite,
      slender, fresh-coloured, small, and pretty-handed, and invariably gay and
      well-dressed. The only fault in her was that a slight over-prominence of
      the dark-blue veins on her little hands rather marred the general effect
      of her appearance. On the other hand, her daughter scarcely ever did
      anything at all. Not only had she no love for trifling with flowers and
      trinkets, but she neglected her personal exterior, and only troubled to
      dress herself well when guests happened to call. Yet, on returning to the
      room in society costume, she always looked extremely handsome&mdash;save
      for that cold, uniform expression of eyes and smile which is common to all
      beauties. In fact, her strictly regular, beautiful face and symmetrical
      figure always seemed to be saying to you, &ldquo;Yes, you may look at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, for all the mother&rsquo;s liveliness of disposition and the
      daughter&rsquo;s air of indifference and abstraction, something told one that
      the former was incapable of feeling affection for anything that was not
      pretty and gay, but that Avdotia, on the contrary, was one of those
      natures which, once they love, are willing to sacrifice their whole life
      for the man they adore.

    <h2>
      XXXIV. MY FATHER&rsquo;S SECOND MARRIAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      MY father was forty-eight when he took as his second wife Avdotia
      Vassilievna Epifanov.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suspect that when, that spring, he had departed for the country with the
      girls, he had been in that communicatively happy, sociable mood in which
      gamblers usually find themselves who have retired from play after winning
      large stakes. He had felt that he still had a fortune left to him which,
      so long as he did not squander it on gaming, might be used for our
      advancement in life. Moreover, it was springtime, he was unexpectedly well
      supplied with ready money, he was alone, and he had nothing to do. As he
      conversed with Jakoff on various matters, and remembered both the
      interminable suit with the Epifanovs and Avdotia&rsquo;s beauty (it was a long
      while since he had seen her), I can imagine him saying: &ldquo;How do you think
      we ought to act in this suit, Jakoff? My idea is simply to let the cursed
      land go. Eh? What do you think about it?&rdquo; I can imagine, too, how, thus
      interrogated, Jakoff twirled his fingers behind his back in a deprecatory
      sort of way, and proceeded to argue that it all the same, &ldquo;Peter
      Alexandritch, we are in the right.&rdquo; Nevertheless, I further conjecture,
      Papa ordered the dogcart to be got ready, put on his fashionable
      olive-coloured driving-coat, brushed up the remnants of his hair,
      sprinkled his clothes with scent, and, greatly pleased to think that he
      was acting a la seignior (as well as, even more, revelling in the prospect
      of soon seeing a pretty woman), drove off to visit his neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can imagine, too, that when the flustered housemaid ran to inform Peter
      Vassilievitch that Monsieur Irtenieff himself had called, Peter answered
      angrily, &ldquo;Well, what has he come for?&rdquo; and, stepping softly about the
      house, first went into his study to put on his old soiled jacket, and then
      sent down word to the cook that on no account whatever&mdash;no, not even
      if she were ordered to do so by the mistress herself&mdash;was she to add
      anything to luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since, later, I often saw Papa with Peter, I can form a very good idea of
      this first interview between them. I can imagine that, despite Papa&rsquo;s
      proposal to end the suit in a peaceful manner, Peter was morose and
      resentful at the thought of having sacrificed his career to his mother,
      and at Papa having done nothing of the kind&mdash;a by no means surprising
      circumstance, Peter probably said to himself. Next, I can see Papa taking
      no notice of this ill-humour, but cracking quips and jests, while Peter
      gradually found himself forced to treat him as a humorist with whom he
      felt offended one moment and inclined to be reconciled the next. Indeed,
      with his instinct for making fun of everything, Papa often used to address
      Peter as &ldquo;Colonel;&rdquo; and though I can remember Peter once replying, with an
      unusually violent stutter and his face scarlet with indignation, that he
      had never been a c-c-colonel, but only a l-l-lieutenant, Papa called him
      &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; again before another five minutes were out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lubotshka told me that, up to the time of Woloda&rsquo;s and my arrival from
      Moscow, there had been daily meetings with the Epifanovs, and that things
      had been very lively, since Papa, who had a genius for arranging,
      everything with a touch of originality and wit, as well as in a simple and
      refined manner, had devised shooting and fishing parties and fireworks for
      the Epifanovs&rsquo; benefit. All these festivities&mdash;so said Lubotshka&mdash;would
      have gone off splendidly but for the intolerable Peter, who had spoilt
      everything by his puffing and stuttering. After our coming, however, the
      Epifanovs only visited us twice, and we went once to their house, while
      after St. Peter&rsquo;s Day (on which, it being Papa&rsquo;s nameday, the Epifanovs
      called upon us in common with a crowd of other guests) our relations with
      that family came entirely to an end, and, in future, only Papa went to see
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the brief period when I had opportunities of seeing Papa and
      Dunetchka (as her mother called Avdotia) together, this is what I remarked
      about them. Papa remained unceasingly in the same buoyant mood as had so
      greatly struck me on the day after our arrival. So gay and youthful and
      full of life and happy did he seem that the beams of his felicity extended
      themselves to all around him, and involuntarily communicated to them a
      similar frame of mind. He never stirred from Avdotia&rsquo;s side so long as she
      was in the room, but either kept on plying her with sugary-sweet
      compliments which made me feel ashamed for him or, with his gaze fixed
      upon her with an air at once passionate and complacent, sat hitching his
      shoulder and coughing as from time to time he smiled and whispered
      something in her ear. Yet throughout he wore the same expression of
      raillery as was peculiar to him even in the most serious matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, Avdotia herself seemed to catch the infection of the happiness
      which sparkled at this period in Papa&rsquo;s large blue eyes; yet there were
      moments also when she would be seized with such a fit of shyness that I,
      who knew the feeling well, was full of sympathy and compassion as I
      regarded her embarrassment. At moments of this kind she seemed to be
      afraid of every glance and every movement&mdash;to be supposing that every
      one was looking at her, every one thinking of no one but her, and that
      unfavourably. She would glance timidly from one person to another, the
      colour coming and going in her cheeks, and then begin to talk loudly and
      defiantly, but, for the most part, nonsense; until presently, realising
      this, and supposing that Papa and every one else had heard her, she would
      blush more painfully than ever. Yet Papa never noticed her nonsense, for
      he was too much taken up with coughing and with gazing at her with his
      look of happy, triumphant devotion. I noticed, too, that, although these
      fits of shyness attacked Avdotia, without any visible cause, they not
      infrequently ensued upon Papa&rsquo;s mention of one or another young and
      beautiful woman. Frequent transitions from depression to that strange,
      awkward gaiety of hers to which I have referred before the repetition of
      favourite words and turns of speech of Papa&rsquo;s; the continuation of
      discussions with others which Papa had already begun&mdash;all these
      things, if my father had not been the principal actor in the matter and I
      had been a little older, would have explained to me the relations
      subsisting between him and Avdotia. At the time, however, I never surmised
      them&mdash;no, not even when Papa received from her brother Peter a letter
      which so upset him that not again until the end of August did he go to
      call upon the Epifanovs&rsquo;. Then, however, he began his visits once more,
      and ended by informing us, on the day before Woloda and I were to return
      to Moscow, that he was about to take Avdotia Vassilievna Epifanov to be
      his wife.

    <h2>
      XXXV. HOW WE RECEIVED THE NEWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yet, even on the eve of the official announcement, every one had learnt of
      the matter, and was discussing it. Mimi never left her room that day, and
      wept copiously. Katenka kept her company, and only came out for luncheon,
      with a grieved expression on her face which was manifestly borrowed from
      her mother. Lubotshka, on the contrary, was very cheerful, and told us
      after luncheon that she knew of a splendid secret which she was going to
      tell no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing so splendid about your secret,&rdquo; said Woloda, who did not
      in the least share her satisfaction. &ldquo;If you were capable of any serious
      thought at all, you would understand that it is a very bad lookout for
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubotshka stared at him in amazement, and said no more. After the meal was
      over, Woloda made a feint of taking me by the arm, and then, fearing that
      this would seem too much like &ldquo;affection,&rdquo; nudged me gently by the elbow,
      and beckoned me towards the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, I suppose, what the secret is of which Lubotshka was speaking?&rdquo;
       he said when he was sure that we were alone. It was seldom that he and I
      spoke together in confidence: with the result that, whenever it came
      about, we felt a kind of awkwardness in one another&rsquo;s presence, and &ldquo;boys
      began to jump about&rdquo; in our eyes, as Woloda expressed it. On the present
      occasion, however, he answered the excitement in my eyes with a grave,
      fixed look which said: &ldquo;You need not be surprised, for we are brothers,
      and we have to consider an important family matter.&rdquo; I understood him, and
      he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, I suppose, that Papa is going to marry Avdotia Epifanov?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, for I had already heard so. &ldquo;Well, it is not a good thing,&rdquo;
       continued Woloda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he repeated irritably. &ldquo;Because it will be so pleasant, won&rsquo;t it,
      to have this stuttering &lsquo;colonel&rsquo; and all his family for relations!
      Certainly she seems nice enough, as yet; but who knows what she will turn
      out to be later? It won&rsquo;t matter much to you or myself, but Lubotshka will
      soon be making her debut, and it will hardly be nice for her to have such
      a &lsquo;belle mere&rsquo; as this&mdash;a woman who speaks French badly, and has no
      manners to teach her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although it seemed odd to hear Woloda criticising Papa&rsquo;s choice so coolly,
      I felt that he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is he marrying her?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is a hole-and-corner business, and God only knows why,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;All I know is that her brother, Peter, tried to make conditions
      about the marriage, and that, although at first Papa would not hear of
      them, he afterwards took some fancy or knight-errantry or another into his
      head. But, as I say, it is a hole-and-corner business. I am only just
      beginning to understand my father &ldquo;&mdash;the fact that Woloda called Papa
      &ldquo;my father&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Papa&rdquo; somehow hurt me&mdash;&ldquo;and though I can see
      that he is kind and clever, he is irresponsible and frivolous to a degree
      that&mdash;Well, the whole thing is astonishing. He cannot so much as look
      upon a woman calmly. You yourself know how he falls in love with every one
      that he meets. You know it, and so does Mimi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say. Not long ago I learnt that he used to be in love with Mimi
      herself when he was a young man, and that he used to send her poetry, and
      that there really was something between them. Mimi is heart-sore about it
      to this day&rdquo;&mdash;and Woloda burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; I cried in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the principal thing at this moment,&rdquo; went on Woloda, becoming serious
      again, and relapsing into French, &ldquo;is to think how delighted all our
      relations will be with this marriage! Why, she will probably have
      children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Woloda&rsquo;s prudence and forethought struck me so forcibly that I had no
      answer to make. Just at this moment Lubotshka approached us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you know?&rdquo; she said with a joyful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Woloda. &ldquo;Still, I am surprised at you, Lubotshka. You are no
      longer a baby in long clothes. Why should you be so pleased because Papa
      is going to marry a piece of trash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Lubotshka&rsquo;s face fell, and she became serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Woloda!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why &lsquo;a piece of trash&rsquo; indeed? How can you
      dare to speak of Avdotia like that? If Papa is going to marry her she
      cannot be &lsquo;trash.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not trash, so to speak, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No &lsquo;buts&rsquo; at all!&rdquo; interrupted Lubotshka, flaring up. &ldquo;You have never
      heard me call the girl whom you are in love with &lsquo;trash!&rsquo; How, then, can
      you speak so of Papa and a respectable woman? Although you are my elder
      brother, I won&rsquo;t allow you to speak like that! You ought not to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I even express an opinion about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you mayn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; repeated Lubotshka. &ldquo;No one ought to criticise such a
      father as ours. Mimi has the right to, but not you, however much you may
      be the eldest brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you don&rsquo;t understand anything,&rdquo; said Woloda contemptuously. &ldquo;Try and
      do so. How can it be a good thing that a &lsquo;Dunetchka&rsquo; of an Epifanov should
      take the place of our dead Mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Lubotshka was silent. Then the tears suddenly came into her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that you were conceited, but I never thought that you could be
      cruel,&rdquo; she said, and left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Woloda, pulling a serio-comic face and make-believe, stupid
      eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what comes of arguing with them.&rdquo; Evidently he felt that he
      was at fault in having so far forgot himself as to descend to discuss
      matters at all with Lubotshka.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the weather was bad, and neither Papa nor the ladies had come
      down to morning tea when I entered the drawing-room. There had been cold
      rain in the night, and remnants of the clouds from which it had descended
      were still scudding across the sky, with the sun&rsquo;s luminous disc (not yet
      risen to any great height) showing faintly through them. It was a windy,
      damp, grey morning. The door into the garden was standing open, and pools
      left by the night&rsquo;s rain were drying on the damp-blackened flags of the
      terrace. The open door was swinging on its iron hinges in the wind, and
      all the paths looked wet and muddy. The old birch trees with their naked
      white branches, the bushes, the turf, the nettles, the currant-trees, the
      elders with the pale side of their leaves turned upwards&mdash;all were
      dashing themselves about, and looking as though they were trying to wrench
      themselves free from their roots. From the avenue of lime-trees showers of
      round, yellow leaves were flying through the air in tossing, eddying
      circles, and strewing the wet road and soaked aftermath of the hayfield
      with a clammy carpet. At the moment, my thoughts were wholly taken up with
      my father&rsquo;s approaching marriage and with the point of view from which
      Woloda regarded it. The future seemed to me to bode no good for any of us.
      I felt distressed to think that a woman who was not only a stranger but
      young should be going to associate with us in so many relations of life,
      without having any right to do so&mdash;nay, that this young woman was
      going to usurp the place of our dead mother. I felt depressed, and kept
      thinking more and more that my father was to blame in the matter.
      Presently I heard his voice and Woloda&rsquo;s speaking together in the pantry,
      and, not wishing to meet Papa just then, had just left the room when I was
      pursued by Lubotshka, who said that Papa wanted to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing in the drawing-room, with his hand resting on the piano,
      and was gazing in my direction with an air at once grave and impatient.
      His face no longer wore the youthful, gay expression which had struck me
      for so long, but, on the contrary, looked sad. Woloda was walking about
      the room with a pipe in his hand. I approached my father, and bade him
      good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my children,&rdquo; he said firmly, with a lift of his head and in the
      peculiarly hurried manner of one who wishes to announce something
      obviously unwelcome, but no longer admitting of reconsideration, &ldquo;you
      know, I suppose, that I am going to marry Avdotia Epifanov.&rdquo; He paused a
      moment. &ldquo;Hitherto I had had no desire for any one to succeed your mother,
      but&rdquo;&mdash;and again he paused&mdash;&ldquo;it-it is evidently my fate.
      Dunetchka is an excellent, kind girl, and no longer in her first youth. I
      hope, therefore, my children, that you will like her, and she, I know,
      will be sincerely fond of you, for she is a good woman. And now,&rdquo; he went
      on, addressing himself more particularly to Woloda and myself, and having
      the appearance of speaking hurriedly in order to prevent us from
      interrupting him, &ldquo;it is time for you to depart, while I myself am going
      to stay here until the New Year, and then to follow you to Moscow with&rdquo;&mdash;again
      he hesitated a moment&mdash;&ldquo;my wife and Lubotshka.&rdquo; It hurt me to see my
      father standing as though abashed and at fault before us, so I moved a
      little nearer him, but Woloda only went on walking about the room with his
      head down, and smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, my children, that is what your old father has planned to do,&rdquo;
       concluded Papa&mdash;reddening, coughing, and offering Woloda and myself
      his hands. Tears were in his eyes as he said this, and I noticed, too,
      that the hand which he was holding out to Woloda (who at that moment
      chanced to be at the other end of the room) was shaking slightly. The
      sight of that shaking hand gave me an unpleasant shock, for I remembered
      that Papa had served in 1812, and had been, as every one knew, a brave
      officer. Seizing the great veiny hand, I covered it with kisses, and he
      squeezed mine hard in return. Then, with a sob amid his tears, he suddenly
      threw his arms around Lubotshka&rsquo;s dark head, and kissed her again and
      again on the eyes. Woloda pretended that he had dropped his pipe, and,
      bending down, wiped his eyes furtively with the back of his hand. Then,
      endeavouring to escape notice, he left the room.

    <h2>
      XXXVI. THE UNIVERSITY
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE wedding was to take place in two weeks&rsquo; time, but, as our lectures had
      begun already, Woloda and myself were forced to return to Moscow at the
      beginning of September. The Nechludoffs had also returned from the
      country, and Dimitri (with whom, on parting, I had made an agreement that
      we should correspond frequently with the result, of course, that we had
      never once written to one another) came to see us immediately after our
      arrival, and arranged to escort me to my first lecture on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful sunny day. No sooner had I entered the auditorium than
      I felt my personality entirely disappear amid the swarm of light-hearted
      youths who were seething tumultuously through every doorway and corridor
      under the influence of the sunlight pouring through the great windows. I
      found the sense of being a member of this huge community very pleasing,
      yet there were few among the throng whom I knew, and that only on terms of
      a nod and a &ldquo;How do you do, Irtenieff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All around me men were shaking hands and chatting together&mdash;from
      every side came expressions of friendship, laughter, jests, and badinage.
      Everywhere I could feel the tie which bound this youthful society in one,
      and everywhere, too, I could feel that it left me out. Yet this impression
      lasted for a moment only, and was succeeded, together with the vexation
      which it had caused, by the idea that it was best that I should not belong
      to that society, but keep to my own circle of gentlemen; wherefore I
      proceeded to seat myself upon the third bench, with, as neighbours, Count
      B., Baron Z., the Prince R., Iwin, and some other young men of the same
      class with none of whom, however, was acquainted save with Iwin and Count
      B. Yet the look which these young gentlemen threw at me at once made me
      feel that I was not of their set, and I turned to observe what was going
      on around me. Semenoff, with grey, matted hair, white teeth, and tunic
      flying open, was seated a little distance off, and leaning forward on his
      elbows as he nibbled a pen, while the gymnasium student who had come out
      first in the examinations had established himself on the front bench, and,
      with a black stock coming half-way up his cheek, was toying with the
      silver watch-chain which adorned his satin waistcoat. On a bench in a
      raised part of the hall I could descry Ikonin (evidently he had contrived
      to enter the University somehow!), and hear him fussily proclaiming, in
      all the glory of blue piped trousers which completely hid his boots, that
      he was now seated on Parnassus. Ilinka&mdash;who had surprised me by
      giving me a bow not only cold, but supercilious, as though to remind me
      that here we were all equals&mdash;was just in front of me, with his legs
      resting in free and easy style on another bench (a hit, somehow I thought,
      at myself), and conversing with a student as he threw occasional glances
      in my direction. Iwin&rsquo;s set by my side were talking in French, yet every
      word which I overheard of their conversation seemed to me both stupid and
      incorrect (&ldquo;Ce n&rsquo;est pas francais,&rdquo; I thought to myself), while all the
      attitudes, utterances, and doings of Semenoff, Ilinka, and the rest struck
      me as uniformly coarse, ungentlemanly, and &ldquo;comme il ne faut pas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, attached to no particular set, I felt isolated and unable to make
      friends, and so grew resentful. One of the students on the bench in front
      of me kept biting his nails, which were raw to the quick already, and this
      so disgusted me that I edged away from him. In short, I remember finding
      my first day a most depressing affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the professor entered, and there was a general stir and a cessation
      of chatter, I remember throwing a scornful glance at him, as also that he
      began his discourse with a sentence which I thought devoid of meaning. I
      had expected the lecture to be, from first to last, so clever that not a
      word ought to be taken from or added to it. Disappointed in this, I at
      once proceeded to draw beneath the heading &ldquo;First Lecture&rdquo; with which I
      had adorned my beautifully-bound notebook no less than eighteen faces in
      profile, joined together in a sort of chaplet, and only occasionally moved
      my hand along the page in order to give the professor (who, I felt sure,
      must be greatly interested in me) the impression that I was writing
      something. In fact, at this very first lecture I came to the decision
      which I maintained to the end of my course, namely, that it was
      unnecessary, and even stupid, to take down every word said by every
      professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At subsequent lectures, however, I did not feel my isolation so strongly,
      since I made several acquaintances and got into the way of shaking hands
      and entering into conversation. Yet for some reason or another no real
      intimacy ever sprang up between us, and I often found myself depressed and
      only feigning cheerfulness. With the set which comprised Iwin and &ldquo;the
      aristocrats,&rdquo; as they were generally known, I could not make any headway
      at all, for, as I now remember, I was always shy and churlish to them, and
      nodded to them only when they nodded to me; so that they had little
      inducement to desire my acquaintance. With most of the other students,
      however, this arose from quite a different cause. As soon as ever I
      discerned friendliness on the part of a comrade, I at once gave him to
      understand that I went to luncheon with Prince Ivan Ivanovitch and kept my
      own drozhki. All this I said merely to show myself in the most favourable
      light in his eyes, and to induce him to like me all the more; yet almost
      invariably the only result of my communicating to him the intelligence
      concerning the drozhki and my relationship to Prince Ivan Ivanovitch was
      that, to my astonishment, he at once adopted a cold and haughty bearing
      towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among us we had a Crown student named Operoff&mdash;a very modest,
      industrious, and clever young fellow, who always offered one his hand like
      a slab of wood (that is to say, without closing his fingers or making the
      slightest movement with them); with the result that his comrades often did
      the same to him in jest, and called it the &ldquo;deal board&rdquo; way of shaking
      hands. He and I nearly always sat next to one another, and discussed
      matters generally. In particular he pleased me with the freedom with which
      he would criticise the professors as he pointed out to me with great
      clearness and acumen the merits or demerits of their respective ways of
      teaching and made occasional fun of them. Such remarks I found exceedingly
      striking and diverting when uttered in his quiet, mincing voice.
      Nevertheless he never let a lecture pass without taking careful notes of
      it in his fine handwriting, and eventually we decided to join forces, and
      to do our preparation together. Things had progressed to the point of his
      always looking pleased when I took my usual seat beside him when,
      unfortunately, I one day found it necessary to inform him that, before her
      death, my mother had besought my father never to allow us to enter for a
      government scholarship, as well as that I myself considered Crown
      students, no matter how clever, to be-&ldquo;well, they are not GENTLEMEN,&rdquo; I
      concluded, though beginning to flounder a little and grow red. At the
      moment Operoff said nothing, but at subsequent lectures he ceased to greet
      me or to offer me his board-like hand, and never attempted to talk to me,
      but, as soon as ever I sat down, he would lean his head upon his arm, and
      purport to be absorbed in his notebooks. I was surprised at this sudden
      coolness, but looked upon it as infra dig, &ldquo;pour un jeune homme de bonne
      maison&rdquo; to curry favour with a mere Crown student of an Operoff, and so
      left him severely alone&mdash;though I confess that his aloofness hurt my
      feelings. On one occasion I arrived before him, and, since the lecture was
      to be delivered by a popular professor whom students came to hear who did
      not usually attend such functions, I found almost every seat occupied.
      Accordingly I secured Operoff&rsquo;s place for myself by spreading my notebooks
      on the desk before it; after which I left the room again for a moment.
      When I returned I perceived that my paraphernalia had been relegated to
      the bench behind, and the place taken by Operoff himself. I remarked to
      him that I had already secured it by placing my notebooks there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about that,&rdquo; he replied sharply, yet without looking up at
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I placed my notebooks there,&rdquo; I repeated, purposely trying to
      bluster, in the hope of intimidating him. &ldquo;Every one saw me do it,&rdquo; I
      added, including the students near me in my glance. Several of them looked
      at me with curiosity, yet none of them spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seats cannot be booked here,&rdquo; said Operoff. &ldquo;Whoever first sits down in a
      place keeps it,&rdquo; and, settling himself angrily where he was, he flashed at
      me a glance of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that only means that you are a cad,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have an idea that he murmured something about my being &ldquo;a stupid young
      idiot,&rdquo; but I decided not to hear it. What would be the use, I asked
      myself, of my hearing it? That we should brawl like a couple of manants
      over less than nothing? (I was very fond of the word manants, and often
      used it for meeting awkward junctures.) Perhaps I should have said
      something more had not, at that moment, a door slammed and the professor
      (dressed in a blue frockcoat, and shuffling his feet as he walked)
      ascended the rostrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, when the examination was about to come on, and I had need of
      some one&rsquo;s notebooks, Operoff remembered his promise to lend me his, and
      we did our preparation together.

    <h2>
      XXXVII. AFFAIRS OF THE HEART
    </h2>
    <p>
      Affaires du coeur exercised me greatly that winter. In fact, I fell in
      love three times. The first time, I became passionately enamoured of a
      buxom lady whom I used to see riding at Freitag&rsquo;s riding-school; with the
      result that every day when she was taking a lesson there (that is to say,
      every Tuesday and Friday) I used to go to gaze at her, but always in such
      a state of trepidation lest I should be seen that I stood a long way off,
      and bolted directly I thought her likely to approach the spot where I was
      standing. Likewise, I used to turn round so precipitately whenever she
      appeared to be glancing in my direction that I never saw her face well,
      and to this day do not know whether she was really beautiful or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dubkoff, who was acquainted with her, surprised me one day in the
      riding-school, where I was lurking concealed behind the lady&rsquo;s grooms and
      the fur wraps which they were holding, and, having heard from Dimitri of
      my infatuation, frightened me so terribly by proposing to introduce me to
      the Amazon that I fled incontinently from the school, and was prevented by
      the mere thought that possibly he had told her about me from ever entering
      the place again, or even from hiding behind her grooms, lest I should
      encounter her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I fell in love with ladies whom I did not know, and especially
      married women, I experienced a shyness a thousand times greater than I had
      ever felt with Sonetchka. I dreaded beyond measure that my divinity should
      learn of my passion, or even of my existence, since I felt sure that, once
      she had done so, she would be so terribly offended that I should never be
      forgiven for my presumption. And indeed, if the Amazon referred to above
      had ever come to know how I used to stand behind the grooms and dream of
      seizing her and carrying her off to some country spot&mdash;if she had
      ever come to know how I should have lived with her there, and how I should
      have treated her, it is probable that she would have had very good cause
      for indignation! But I always felt that, once I got to know her, she would
      straightway divine these thoughts, and consider herself insulted by my
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my second affaire du coeur, I, (for the third time) fell in love with
      Sonetchka when I saw her at her sister&rsquo;s. My second passion for her had
      long since come to an end, but I became enamoured of her this third time
      through Lubotshka sending me a copy-book in which Sonetchka had copied
      some extracts from Lermontoff&rsquo;s The Demon, with certain of the more subtly
      amorous passages underlined in red ink and marked with pressed flowers.
      Remembering how Woloda had been wont to kiss his inamorata&rsquo;s purse last
      year, I essayed to do the same thing now; and really, when alone in my
      room in the evenings and engaged in dreaming as I looked at a flower or
      occasionally pressed it to my lips, I would feel a certain pleasantly
      lachrymose mood steal over me, and remain genuinely in love (or suppose
      myself to be so) for at least several days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, my third affaire du coeur that winter was connected with the lady
      with whom Woloda was in love, and who used occasionally to visit at our
      house. Yet, in this damsel, as I now remember, there was not a single
      beautiful feature to be found&mdash;or, at all events, none of those which
      usually pleased me. She was the daughter of a well-known Moscow lady of
      light and leading, and, petite and slender, wore long flaxen curls after
      the English fashion, and could boast of a transparent profile. Every one
      said that she was even cleverer and more learned than her mother, but I
      was never in a position to judge of that, since, overcome with craven
      bashfulness at the mere thought of her intellect and accomplishments, I
      never spoke to her alone but once, and then with unaccountable
      trepidation. Woloda&rsquo;s enthusiasm, however (for the presence of an audience
      never prevented him from giving vent to his rapture), communicated itself
      to me so strongly that I also became enamoured of the lady. Yet, conscious
      that he would not be pleased to know that two brothers were in love with
      the same girl, I never told him of my condition. On the contrary, I took
      special delight in the thought that our mutual love for her was so pure
      that, though its object was, in both cases, the same charming being, we
      remained friends and ready, if ever the occasion should arise, to
      sacrifice ourselves for one another. Yet I have an idea that, as regards
      self-sacrifice, he did not quite share my views, for he was so
      passionately in love with the lady that once he was for giving a member of
      the diplomatic corps, who was said to be going to marry her, a slap in the
      face and a challenge to a duel; but, for my part, I would gladly have
      sacrificed my feelings for his sake, seeing that the fact that the only
      remark I had ever addressed to her had been on the subject of the dignity
      of classical music, and that my passion, for all my efforts to keep it
      alive, expired the following week, would have rendered it the more easy
      for me to do so.

    <h2>
      XXXVIII. THE WORLD
    </h2>
    <p>
      As regards those worldly delights to which I had intended, on entering the
      University, to surrender myself in imitation of my brother, I underwent a
      complete disillusionment that winter. Woloda danced a great deal, and Papa
      also went to balls with his young wife, but I appeared to be thought
      either too young or unfitted for such delights, and no one invited me to
      the houses where balls were being given. Yet, in spite of my vow of
      frankness with Dimitri, I never told him (nor any one else) how much I
      should have liked to go to those dances, and how I felt hurt at being
      forgotten and (apparently) taken for the philosopher that I pretended to
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, a reception was to be given that winter at the Princess
      Kornakoff&rsquo;s, and to it she sent us personal invitations&mdash;to myself
      among the rest! Consequently, I was to attend my first ball. Before
      starting, Woloda came into my room to see how I was dressing myself&mdash;an
      act on his part which greatly surprised me and took me aback. In my
      opinion (it must be understood) solicitude about one&rsquo;s dress was a
      shameful thing, and should be kept under, but he seemed to think it a
      thing so natural and necessary that he said outright that he was afraid I
      should be put out of countenance on that score. Accordingly, he bid me don
      my patent leather boots, and was horrified to find that I wanted to put on
      gloves of peau de chamois. Next, he adjusted my watch-chain in a
      particular manner, and carried me off to a hairdresser&rsquo;s near the
      Kuznetski Bridge to have my locks coiffured. That done, he withdrew to a
      little distance and surveyed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he looks right enough now&rdquo; said he to the hairdresser. &ldquo;Only&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
      you smooth those tufts of his in front a little?&rdquo; Yet, for all that
      Monsieur Charles treated my forelocks with one essence and another, they
      persisted in rising up again when ever I put on my hat. In fact, my curled
      and tonsured figure seemed to me to look far worse than it had done
      before. My only hope of salvation lay in an affectation of untidiness.
      Only in that guise would my exterior resemble anything at all. Woloda,
      apparently, was of the same opinion, for he begged me to undo the curls,
      and when I had done so and still looked unpresentable, he ceased to regard
      me at all, but throughout the drive to the Kornakoffs remained silent and
      depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, I entered the Kornakoffs&rsquo; mansion boldly enough, and it was
      only when the Princess had invited me to dance, and I, for some reason or
      another (though I had driven there with no other thought in my head than
      to dance well), had replied that I never indulged in that pastime, that I
      began to blush, and, left solitary among a crowd of strangers, became
      plunged in my usual insuperable and ever-growing shyness. In fact, I
      remained silent on that spot almost the whole evening!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, while a waltz was in progress, one of the young princesses
      came to me and asked me, with the sort of official kindness common to all
      her family, why I was not dancing. I can remember blushing hotly at the
      question, but at the same time feeling&mdash;for all my efforts to prevent
      it&mdash;a self-satisfied smile steal over my face as I began talking, in
      the most inflated and long-winded French, such rubbish as even now, after
      dozens of years, it shames me to recall. It must have been the effect of
      the music, which, while exciting my nervous sensibility, drowned (as I
      supposed) the less intelligible portion of my utterances. Anyhow, I went
      on speaking of the exalted company present, and of the futility of men and
      women, until I had got myself into such a tangle that I was forced to stop
      short in the middle of a word of a sentence which I found myself powerless
      to conclude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the worldly-minded young Princess was shocked by my conduct, and
      gazed at me in reproach; whereat I burst out laughing. At this critical
      moment, Woloda, who had remarked that I was conversing with great
      animation, and probably was curious to know what excuses I was making for
      not dancing, approached us with Dubkoff. Seeing, however, my smiling face
      and the Princess&rsquo;s frightened mien, as well as overhearing the appalling
      rubbish with which I concluded my speech, he turned red in the face, and
      wheeled round again. The Princess also rose and left me. I continued to
      smile, but in such a state of agony from the consciousness of my stupidity
      that I felt ready to sink into the floor. Likewise I felt that, come what
      might, I must move about and say something, in order to effect a change in
      my position. Accordingly I approached Dubkoff, and asked him if he had
      danced many waltzes with her that night. This I feigned to say in a gay
      and jesting manner, yet in reality I was imploring help of the very
      Dubkoff to whom I had cried &ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; on the night of the
      matriculation dinner. By way of answer, he made as though he had not heard
      me, and turned away. Next, I approached Woloda, and said with an effort
      and in a similar tone of assumed gaiety: &ldquo;Hullo, Woloda! Are you played
      out yet?&rdquo; He merely looked at me as much as to say, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t speak to
      me like that if we were alone,&rdquo; and left me without a word, in the evident
      fear that I might continue to attach myself to his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! Even my own brother deserts me!&rdquo; I thought to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet somehow I had not the courage to depart, but remained standing where I
      was until the very end of the evening. At length, when every one was
      leaving the room and crowding into the hall, and a footman slipped my
      greatcoat on to my shoulders in such a way as to tilt up my cap, I gave a
      dreary, half-lachrymose smile, and remarked to no one in particular:
      &ldquo;Comme c&rsquo;est gracieux!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXXIX. THE STUDENTS&rsquo; FEAST
    </h2>
    <p>
      NOTWITHSTANDING that, as yet, Dimitri&rsquo;s influence had kept me from
      indulging in those customary students&rsquo; festivities known as kutezhi or
      &ldquo;wines,&rdquo; that winter saw me participate in such a function, and carry away
      with me a not over-pleasant impression of it. This is how it came about.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a lecture soon after the New Year, Baron Z.&mdash;a tall, light-haired
      young fellow of very serious demeanour and regular features&mdash;invited
      us all to spend a sociable evening with him. By &ldquo;us all&rdquo;, I mean all the
      men more or less &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo;, of our course, and exclusive of Grap,
      Semenoff, Operoff, and commoners of that sort. Woloda smiled
      contemptuously when he heard that I was going to a &ldquo;wine&rdquo; of first course
      men, but I looked to derive great and unusual pleasure from this, to me,
      novel method of passing the time. Accordingly, punctually at the appointed
      hour of eight I presented myself at the Baron&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our host, in an open tunic and white waistcoat, received his guests in the
      brilliantly lighted salon and drawing-room of the small mansion where his
      parents lived&mdash;they having given up their reception rooms to him for
      the evening for purposes of this party. In the corridor could be seen the
      heads and skirts of inquisitive domestics, while in the dining-room I
      caught a glimpse of a dress which I imagined to belong to the Baroness
      herself. The guests numbered a score, and were all of them students except
      Herr Frost (in attendance upon Iwin) and a tall, red-faced gentleman who
      was superintending the feast and who was introduced to every one as a
      relative of the Baron&rsquo;s and a former student of the University of Dorpat.
      At first, the excessive brilliancy and formal appointments of the
      reception-rooms had such a chilling effect upon this youthful company that
      every one involuntarily hugged the walls, except a few bolder spirits and
      the ex-Dorpat student, who, with his waistcoat already unbuttoned, seemed
      to be in every room, and in every corner of every room, at once, and
      filled the whole place with his resonant, agreeable, never-ceasing tenor
      voice. The remainder of the guests preferred either to remain silent or to
      talk in discreet tones of professors, faculties, examinations, and other
      serious and interesting matters. Yet every one, without exception, kept
      watching the door of the dining-room, and, while trying to conceal the
      fact, wearing an expression which said: &ldquo;Come! It is time to begin.&rdquo; I too
      felt that it was time to begin, and awaited the beginning with pleasurable
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      After footmen had handed round tea among the guests, the Dorpat student
      asked Frost in Russian:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you make punch, Frost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ja!&rdquo; replied Frost with a joyful flourish of his heels, and the other
      went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you set about it&rdquo; (they addressed each other in the second person
      singular, as former comrades at Dorpat). Frost accordingly departed to the
      dining-room, with great strides of his bowed, muscular legs, and, after
      some walking backwards and forwards, deposited upon the drawing-room table
      a large punchbowl, accompanied by a ten-pound sugar loaf supported on
      three students&rsquo; swords placed crosswise. Meanwhile, the Baron had been
      going round among his guests as they sat regarding the punch-bowl, and
      addressing them, with a face of immutable gravity, in the formula: &ldquo;I beg
      of you all to drink of this loving-cup in student fashion, that there may
      be good-fellowship among the members of our course. Unbutton your
      waistcoats, or take them off altogether, as you please.&rdquo; Already the
      Dorpat student had divested himself of his tunic and rolled up his white
      shirt-sleeves above his elbows, and now, planting his feet firmly apart,
      he proceeded to set fire to the rum in the punch-bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, put out the candles!&rdquo; he cried with a sudden shout so loud and
      insistent that we seemed all of us to be shouting at once. However, we
      still went on silently regarding the punch-bowl and the white shirt of the
      Dorpat student, with a feeling that a moment of great solemnity was
      approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put out the lights, Frost, I tell you!&rdquo; the Dorpat student shouted again.
      Evidently the punch was now sufficiently burnt. Accordingly every one
      helped to extinguish the candles, until the room was in total darkness
      save for a spot where the white shirts and hands of the three students
      supporting the sugarloaf on their crossed swords were lit up by the lurid
      flames from the bowl. Yet the Dorpat student&rsquo;s tenor voice was not the
      only one to be heard, for in different quarters of the room resounded
      chattering and laughter. Many had taken off their tunics (especially
      students whose garments were of fine cloth and perfectly new), and I now
      did the same, with a consciousness that &ldquo;IT&rdquo; was &ldquo;beginning.&rdquo; There had
      been no great festivity as yet, but I felt assured that things would go
      splendidly when once we had begun drinking tumblers of the potion that was
      now in course of preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, the punch was ready, and the Dorpat student, with much
      bespattering of the table as he did so, ladled the liquor into tumblers,
      and cried: &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, please!&rdquo; When we had each of us taken a sticky
      tumbler of the stuff into our hands, the Dorpat student and Frost sang a
      German song in which the word &ldquo;Hoch!&rdquo; kept occurring again and again,
      while we joined, in haphazard fashion, in the chorus. Next we clinked
      glasses together, shouted something in praise of punch, crossed hands, and
      took our first drink of the sweet, strong mixture. After that there was no
      further waiting; the &ldquo;wine&rdquo; was in full swing. The first glassful
      consumed, a second was poured out. Yet, for all that I began to feel a
      throbbing in my temples, and that the flames seemed to be turning purple,
      and that every one around me was laughing and shouting, things seemed
      lacking in real gaiety, and I somehow felt that, as a matter of fact, we
      were all of us finding the affair rather dull, and only PRETENDING to be
      enjoying it. The Dorpat student may have been an exception, for he
      continued to grow more and more red in the face and more and more
      ubiquitous as he filled up empty glasses and stained the table with fresh
      spots of the sweet, sticky stuff. The precise sequence of events I cannot
      remember, but I can recall feeling strongly attracted towards Frost and
      the Dorpat student that evening, learning their German song by heart, and
      kissing them each on their sticky-sweet lips; also that that same evening
      I conceived a violent hatred against the Dorpat student, and was for
      pushing him from his chair, but thought better of it; also that, besides
      feeling the same spirit of independence towards the rest of the company as
      I had felt on the night of the matriculation dinner, my head ached and
      swam so badly that I thought each moment would be my last; also that, for
      some reason or another, we all of us sat down on the floor and imitated
      the movements of rowers in a boat as we sang in chorus, &ldquo;Down our mother
      stream the Volga;&rdquo; also that I conceived this procedure on our part to be
      uncalled for; also that, as I lay prone upon the floor, I crossed my legs
      and began wriggling about like a tsigane; [Gipsy dancer.] also that I
      ricked some one&rsquo;s neck, and came to the conclusion that I should never
      have done such a thing if I had not been drunk; also that we had some
      supper and another kind of liquor, and that I then went to the door to get
      some fresh air; also that my head seemed suddenly to grow chill, and that
      I noticed, as I drove away, that the scat of the vehicle was so sharply
      aslant and slippery that for me to retain my position behind Kuzma was
      impossible; also that he seemed to have turned all flabby, and to be
      waving about like a dish clout. But what I remember best is that
      throughout the whole of that evening I never ceased to feel that I was
      acting with excessive stupidity in pretending to be enjoying myself, to
      like drinking a great deal, and to be in no way drunk, as well as that
      every one else present was acting with equal stupidity in pretending those
      same things. All the time I had a feeling that each one of my companions
      was finding the festivities as distasteful as I was myself; but, in the
      belief that he was the only one doing so, felt himself bound to pretend
      that he was very merry, in order not to mar the general hilarity. Also,
      strange to state, I felt that I ought to keep up this pretence for the
      sole reason that into a punch-bowl there had been poured three bottles of
      champagne at nine roubles the bottle and ten bottles of rum at four&mdash;making
      seventy roubles in all, exclusive of the supper. So convinced of my folly
      did I feel that, when, at next day&rsquo;s lecture, those of my comrades who had
      been at Baron Z.&lsquo;s party seemed not only in no way ashamed to remember
      what they had done, but even talked about it so that other students might
      hear of their doings, I felt greatly astonished. They all declared that it
      had been a splendid &ldquo;wine,&rdquo; that Dorpat students were just the fellows for
      that kind of thing, and that there had been consumed at it no less than
      forty bottles of rum among twenty guests, some of whom had dropped
      senseless under the table! That they should care to talk about such things
      seemed strange enough, but that they should care to lie about them seemed
      absolutely unintelligible.

    <h2>
      XL. MY FRIENDSHIP WITH THE NECHLUDOFFS
    </h2>
    <p>
      That winter, too, I saw a great deal both of Dimitri who often looked us
      up, and of his family, with whom I was beginning to stand on intimate
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nechludoffs (that is to say, mother, aunt, and daughter) always spent
      their evenings at home, at which time the Princess liked young men to
      visit her&mdash;at all events young men of the kind whom she described as
      able to spend an evening without playing cards or dancing. Yet such young
      fellows must have been few and far between, for, although I went to the
      Nechludoffs almost every evening, I seldom found other guests present.
      Thus, I came to know the members of this family and their several
      dispositions well enough to be able to form clear ideas as to their mutual
      relations, and to be quite at home amid the rooms and furniture of their
      house. Indeed, so long as no other guests were present, I felt entirely at
      my ease. True, at first I used to feel a little uncomfortable when left
      alone in the room with Varenika, for I could not rid myself of the idea
      that, though far from pretty, she wished me to fall in love with her; but
      in time this nervousness of mine began to lessen, since she always looked
      so natural, and talked to me so exactly as though she were conversing with
      her brother or Lubov Sergievna, that I came to look upon her simply as a
      person to whom it was in no way dangerous or wrong to show that I took
      pleasure in her company. Throughout the whole of our acquaintance she
      appeared to me merely a plain, though not positively ugly, girl,
      concerning whom one would never ask oneself the question,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I, or am I not, in love with her?&rdquo; Sometimes I would talk to her
      direct, but more often I did so through Dimitri or Lubov Sergievna; and it
      was the latter method which afforded me the most pleasure. I derived
      considerable gratification from discoursing when she was there, from
      hearing her sing, and, in general, from knowing that she was in the same
      room as myself; but it was seldom now that any thoughts of what our future
      relations might ever be, or that any dreams of self-sacrifice for my
      friend if he should ever fall in love with my sister, came into my head.
      If any such ideas or fancies occurred to me, I felt satisfied with the
      present, and drove away all thoughts about the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, in spite of this intimacy, I continued to look upon it as my bounden
      duty to keep the Nechludoffs in general, and Varenika in particular, in
      ignorance of my true feelings and tastes, and strove always to appear
      altogether another young man than what I really was&mdash;to appear,
      indeed, such a young man as could never possibly have existed. I affected
      to be &ldquo;soulful&rdquo; and would go off into raptures and exclamations and
      impassioned gestures whenever I wished it to be thought that anything
      pleased me, while, on the other hand, I tried always to seem indifferent
      towards any unusual circumstance which I myself perceived or which I had
      had pointed out to me. I aimed always at figuring both as a sarcastic
      cynic divorced from every sacred tie and as a shrewd observer, as well as
      at being accounted logical in all my conduct, precise and methodical in
      all my ways of life, and at the same time contemptuous of all materiality.
      I may safely say that I was far better in reality than the strange being
      into whom I attempted to convert myself; yet, whatever I was or was not,
      the Nechludoffs were unfailingly kind to me, and (happily for myself) took
      no notice (as it now appears) of my play-acting. Only Lubov Sergievna,
      who, I believe, really believed me to be a great egoist, atheist, and
      cynic, had no love for me, but frequently disputed what I said, flew into
      tempers, and left me petrified with her disjointed, irrelevant utterances.
      Yet Dimitri held always to the same strange, something more than friendly,
      relations with her, and used to say not only that she was misunderstood by
      every one, but that she did him a world of good. This, however, did not
      prevent the rest of his family from finding fault with his infatuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, when talking to me about this incomprehensible attachment, Varenika
      explained the matter thus: &ldquo;You see, Dimitri is a selfish person. He is
      very proud, and, for all his intellect, very fond of praise, and of
      surprising people, and of always being FIRST, while little Auntie&rdquo; (the
      general nickname for Lubov Sergievna) &ldquo;is innocent enough to admire him,
      and at the same time devoid of the tact to conceal her admiration.
      Consequently she flatters his vanity&mdash;not out of pretence, but
      sincerely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This dictum I laid to heart, and, when thinking it over afterwards, could
      not but come to the conclusion that Varenika was very sensible; wherefore
      I was glad to award her promotion thenceforth in my regard. Yet, though I
      was always glad enough to assign her any credit which might arise from my
      discovering in her character any signs of good sense or other moral
      qualities, I did so with strict moderation, and never ran to any extreme
      pitch of enthusiasm in the process. Thus, when Sophia Ivanovna (who was
      never weary of discussing her niece) related to me how, four years ago,
      Varenika had suddenly given away all her clothes to some peasant children
      without first asking permission to do so, so that the garments had
      subsequently to be recovered, I did not at once accept the fact as
      entitling Varenika to elevation in my opinion, but went on giving her good
      advice about the unpracticalness of such views on property.
    </p>
    <p>
      When other guests were present at the Nechludoffs (among them, sometimes,
      Woloda and Dubkoff) I used to withdraw myself to a remote plane, and, with
      the complacency and quiet consciousness of strength of an habitue of the
      house, listen to what others were saying without putting in a remark
      myself. Yet everything that these others said seemed to me so immeasurably
      stupid that I used to feel inwardly amazed that such a clever, logical
      woman as the Princess, with her equally logical family, could listen to
      and answer such rubbish. Had it, however, entered into my head to compare
      what, others said with what I myself said when there alone, I should
      probably have ceased to feel surprise. Still less should I have continued
      to feel surprise had I not believed that the women of our own household&mdash;Avdotia,
      Lubotshka, and Katenka&mdash;were superior to the rest of their sex, for
      in that case I should have remembered the kind of things over which
      Avdotia and Katenka would laugh and jest with Dubkoff from one end of an
      evening to the other. I should have remembered that seldom did an evening
      pass but Dubkoff would first have, an argument about something, and then
      read in a sententious voice either some verses beginning &ldquo;Au banquet de la
      vie, infortune convive&rdquo; or extracts from The Demon. In short, I should
      have remembered what nonsense they used to chatter for hours at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need hardly be said that, when guests were present, Varenika paid less
      attention to me than when we were alone, as well as that I was deprived of
      the reading and music which I so greatly loved to hear. When talking to
      guests, she lost, in my eyes, her principal charm&mdash;that of quiet
      seriousness and simplicity. I remember how strange it used to seem to me
      to hear her discoursing on theatres and the weather to my brother Woloda!
      I knew that of all things in the world he most despised and shunned
      banality, and that Varenika herself used to make fun of forced
      conversations on the weather and similar matters. Why, then, when meeting
      in society, did they both of them talk such intolerable nothings, and, as
      it were, shame one another? After talks of this kind I used to feel
      silently resentful against Woloda, as well as next day to rally Varenika
      on her overnight guests. Yet one result of it was that I derived all the
      greater pleasure from being one of the Nechludoffs&rsquo; family circle. Also,
      for some reason or another I began to prefer meeting Dimitri in his
      mother&rsquo;s drawing-room to being with him alone.

    </div>
    <h2>
      XLI. MY FRIENDSHIP WITH THE NECHLUDOFFS
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this period, indeed, my friendship with Dimitri hung by a hair. I had
      been criticising him too long not to have discovered faults in his
      character, for it is only in first youth that we love passionately and
      therefore love only perfect people. As soon as the mists engendered by
      love of this kind begin to dissolve, and to be penetrated by the clear
      beams of reason, we see the object of our adoration in his true shape, and
      with all his virtues and failings exposed. Some of those failings strike
      us with the exaggerated force of the unexpected, and combine with the
      instinct for novelty and the hope that perfection may yet be found in a
      fellow-man to induce us not only to feel coldness, but even aversion,
      towards the late object of our adoration. Consequently, desiring it no
      longer, we usually cast it from us, and pass onwards to seek fresh
      perfection. For the circumstance that that was not what occurred with
      respect to my own relation to Dimitri, I was indebted to his stubborn,
      punctilious, and more critical than impulsive attachment to myself&mdash;a
      tie which I felt ashamed to break. Moreover, our strange vow of frankness
      bound us together. We were afraid that, if we parted, we should leave in
      one another&rsquo;s power all the incriminatory moral secrets of which we had
      made mutual confession. At the same time, our rule of frankness had long
      ceased to be faithfully observed, but, on the contrary, proved a frequent
      cause of constraint, and brought about strange relations between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every time that winter that I went upstairs to Dimitri&rsquo;s room, I
      used to find there a University friend of his named Bezobiedoff, with whom
      he appeared to be very much taken up. Bezobiedoff was a small, slight
      fellow, with a face pitted over with smallpox, freckled, effeminate hands,
      and a huge flaxen moustache much in need of the comb. He was invariably
      dirty, shabby, uncouth, and uninteresting. To me, Dimitri&rsquo;s relations with
      him were as unintelligible as his relations with Lubov Sergievna, and the
      only reason he could have had for choosing such a man for his associate
      was that in the whole University there was no worse-looking student than
      Bezobiedoff. Yet that alone would have been sufficient to make Dimitri
      extend him his friendship, and, as a matter of fact, in all his
      intercourse with this fellow he seemed to be saying proudly: &ldquo;I care
      nothing who a man may be. In my eyes every one is equal. I like him, and
      therefore he is a desirable acquaintance.&rdquo; Nevertheless I could not
      imagine how he could bring himself to do it, nor how the wretched
      Bezobiedoff ever contrived to maintain his awkward position. To me the
      friendship seemed a most distasteful one.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, I went up to Dimitri&rsquo;s room to try and get him to come down for
      an evening&rsquo;s talk in his mother&rsquo;s drawing-room, where we could also listen
      to Varenika&rsquo;s reading and singing, but Bezobiedoff had forestalled me
      there, and Dimitri answered me curtly that he could not come down, since,
      as I could see for myself, he had a visitor with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what is the fun of sitting there? We had much better
      stay HERE and talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I scarcely relished the prospect of spending a couple of hours in
      Bezobiedoff&rsquo;s company, yet could not make up my mind to go down alone;
      wherefore, cursing my friend&rsquo;s vagaries, I seated myself in a
      rocking-chair, and began rocking myself silently to and fro. I felt vexed
      with them both for depriving me of the pleasures of the drawing-room, and
      my only hope as I listened irritably to their conversation was that
      Bezobiedoff would soon take his departure. &ldquo;A nice guest indeed to be
      sitting with!&rdquo; I thought to myself when a footman brought in tea and
      Dimitri had five times to beg Bezobiedoff to have a cup, for the reason
      that the bashful guest thought it incumbent upon him always to refuse it
      at first and to say, &ldquo;No, help yourself.&rdquo; I could see that Dimitri had to
      put some restraint upon himself as he resumed the conversation. He tried
      to inveigle me also into it, but I remained glum and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mean to let my face give any one the suspicion that I am bored&rdquo;
       was my mental remark to Dimitri as I sat quietly rocking myself to and fro
      with measured beat. Yet, as the moments passed, I found myself&mdash;not
      without a certain satisfaction&mdash;growing more and more inwardly
      hostile to my friend. &ldquo;What a fool he is!&rdquo; I reflected. &ldquo;He might be
      spending the evening agreeably with his charming family, yet he goes on
      sitting with this brute!&mdash;will go on doing so, too, until it is too
      late to go down to the drawing-room!&rdquo; Here I glanced at him over the back
      of my chair, and thought the general look of his attitude and appearance
      so offensive and repellant that at the moment I could gladly have offered
      him some insult, even a most serious one.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Bezobiedoff rose, but Dimitri could not easily let such a
      delightful friend depart, and asked him to stay the night. Fortunately,
      Bezobiedoff declined the invitation, and departed. Having seen him off,
      Dimitri returned, and, smiling a faintly complacent smile as he did so,
      and rubbing his hands together (in all probability partly because he had
      sustained his character for eccentricity, and partly because he had got
      rid of a bore), started to pace the room, with an occasional glance at
      myself. I felt more offended with him than ever. &ldquo;How can he go on walking
      about the room and grinning like that?&rdquo; was my inward reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you so angry about?&rdquo; he asked me suddenly as he halted in front
      of my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the least angry,&rdquo; I replied (as people always do answer under
      such circumstances). &ldquo;I am merely vexed that you should play-act to me,
      and to Bezobiedoff, and to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rubbish!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I never play-act to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have in mind our rule of frankness,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;when I tell you that I
      am certain you cannot bear this Bezobiedoff any more than I can. He is an
      absolute cad, yet for some inexplicable reason or another it pleases you
      to masquerade before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all! To begin with, he is a splendid fellow, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you it IS so. I also tell you that your friendship for Lubov
      Sergievna is founded on the same basis, namely, that she thinks you a
      god.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you once more that it is not so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know it for myself,&rdquo; I retorted with the heat of suppressed anger,
      and designing to disarm him with my frankness. &ldquo;I have told you before,
      and I repeat it now, that you always seem to like people who say pleasant
      things to you, but that, as soon as ever I come to examine your
      friendship, I invariably find that there exists no real attachment between
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you are wrong,&rdquo; said Dimitri with an angry straightening of the
      neck in his collar. &ldquo;When I like people, neither their praise nor their
      blame can make any difference to my opinion of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dreadful though it may seem to you, I confess that I myself often
      used to hate my father when he abused me, and to wish that he was dead. In
      the same way, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak for yourself. I am very sorry that you could ever have been so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I cried as I leapt from my chair and faced him with the courage
      of exasperation. &ldquo;It is for YOURSELF that you ought to feel sorry&mdash;sorry
      because you never told me a word about this fellow. You know that was not
      honourable of you. Nevertheless, I will tell YOU what I think of you,&rdquo;
       and, burning to wound him even more than he had wounded me, I set out to
      prove to him that he was incapable of feeling any real affection for
      anybody, and that I had the best of grounds (as in very truth I believed I
      had) for reproaching him. I took great pleasure in telling him all this,
      but at the same time forgot that the only conceivable purpose of my doing
      so&mdash;to force him to confess to the faults of which I had accused him&mdash;could
      not possibly be attained at the present moment, when he was in a rage. Had
      he, on the other hand, been in a condition to argue calmly, I should
      probably never have said what I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dispute was verging upon an open quarrel when Dimitri suddenly became
      silent, and left the room. I pursued him, and continued what I was saying,
      but he did not answer. I knew that his failings included a hasty temper,
      and that he was now fighting it down; wherefore I cursed his good
      resolutions the more in my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was what our rule of frankness had brought us to&mdash;the
      rule that we should &ldquo;tell one another everything in our minds, and never
      discuss one another with a third person!&rdquo; Many a time we had exaggerated
      frankness to the pitch of making mutual confession of the most shameless
      thoughts, and of shaming ourselves by voicing to one another proposals or
      schemes for attaining our desires; yet those confessions had not only
      failed to draw closer the tie which united us, but had dissipated sympathy
      and thrust us further apart, until now pride would not allow him to expose
      his feelings even in the smallest detail, and we employed in our quarrel
      the very weapons which we had formerly surrendered to one another&mdash;the
      weapons which could strike the shrewdest blows!

    <h2>
      XLII. OUR STEPMOTHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding that Papa had not meant to return to Moscow before the New
      Year, he arrived in October, when there was still good riding to hounds to
      be had in the country. He alleged as his reason for changing his mind that
      his suit was shortly to come on before the Senate, but Mimi averred that
      Avdotia had found herself so ennuyee in the country, and had so often
      talked about Moscow and pretended to be unwell, that Papa had decided to
      accede to her wishes. &ldquo;You see, she never really loved him&mdash;she and
      her love only kept buzzing about his ears because she wanted to marry a
      rich man,&rdquo; added Mimi with a pensive sigh which said: &ldquo;To think what a
      certain other person could have done for him if only he had valued her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet that &ldquo;certain other person&rdquo; was unjust to Avdotia, seeing that the
      latter&rsquo;s affection for Papa&mdash;the passionate, devoted love of
      self-abandonment&mdash;revealed itself in her every look and word and
      movement. At the same time, that love in no way hindered her, not only
      from being averse to parting with her adored husband, but also from
      desiring to visit Madame Annette&rsquo;s and order there a lovely cap, a hat
      trimmed with a magnificent blue ostrich feather, and a blue Venetian
      velvet bodice which was to expose to the public gaze the snowy, well
      shaped breast and arms which no one had yet gazed upon except her husband
      and maids. Of course Katenka sided with her mother and, in general, there
      became established between Avdotia and ourselves, from the day of her
      arrival, the most extraordinary and burlesque order of relations. As soon
      as she stepped from the carriage, Woloda assumed an air of great
      seriousness and ceremony, and, advancing towards her with much bowing and
      scraping, said in the tone of one who is presenting something for
      acceptance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honour to greet the arrival of our dear Mamma, and to kiss her
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear son!&rdquo; she replied with her beautiful, unvarying smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do not forget the younger son,&rdquo; I said as I also approached her hand,
      with an involuntary imitation of Woloda&rsquo;s voice and expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had our stepmother and ourselves been certain of any mutual affection,
      that expression might have signified contempt for any outward
      manifestation of our love. Had we been ill-disposed towards one another,
      it might have denoted irony, or contempt for pretence, or a desire to
      conceal from Papa (standing by the while) our real relations, as well as
      many other thoughts and sentiments. But, as a matter of fact, that
      expression (which well consorted with Avdotia&rsquo;s own spirit) simply
      signified nothing at all&mdash;simply concealed the absence of any
      definite relations between us. In later life I often had occasion to
      remark, in the case of other families whose members anticipated among
      themselves relations not altogether harmonious, the sort of provisional,
      burlesque relations which they formed for daily use; and it was just such
      relations as those which now became established between ourselves and our
      stepmother. We scarcely ever strayed beyond them, but were polite to her,
      conversed with her in French, bowed and scraped before her, and called her
      &ldquo;chere Maman&rdquo;&mdash;a term to which she always responded in a tone of
      similar lightness and with her beautiful, unchanging smile. Only the
      lachrymose Lubotshka, with her goose feet and artless prattle, really
      liked our stepmother, or tried, in her naive and frequently awkward way,
      to bring her and ourselves together: wherefore the only person in the
      world for whom, besides Papa, Avdotia had a spark of affection was
      Lubotshka. Indeed, Avdotia always treated her with a kind of grave
      admiration and timid deference which greatly surprised me.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first Avdotia was very fond of calling herself our stepmother and
      hinting that, since children and servants usually adopt an unjust and
      hostile attitude towards a woman thus situated, her own position was
      likely to prove a difficult one. Yet, though she foresaw all the
      unpleasantness of her predicament, she did nothing to escape from it by
      (for instance) conciliating this one, giving presents to that other one,
      and forbearing to grumble&mdash;the last a precaution which it would have
      been easy for her to take, seeing that by nature she was in no way
      exacting, as well as very good-tempered. Yet, not only did she do none of
      these things, but her expectation of difficulties led her to adopt the
      defensive before she had been attacked. That is to say, supposing that the
      entire household was designing to show her every kind of insult and
      annoyance, she would see plots where no plots were, and consider that her
      most dignified course was to suffer in silence&mdash;an attitude of
      passivity as regards winning AFfection which of course led to
      DISaffection. Moreover, she was so totally lacking in that faculty of
      &ldquo;apprehension&rdquo; to which I have already referred as being highly developed
      in our household, and all her customs were so utterly opposed to those
      which had long been rooted in our establishment, that those two facts
      alone were bound to go against her. From the first, her mode of life in
      our tidy, methodical household was that of a person only just arrived
      there. Sometimes she went to bed late, sometimes early; sometimes she
      appeared at luncheon, sometimes she did not; sometimes she took supper,
      sometimes she dispensed with it. When we had no guests with us she more
      often than not walked about the house in a semi-nude condition, and was
      not ashamed to appear before us&mdash;even before the servants&mdash;in a
      white chemise, with only a shawl thrown over her bare shoulders. At first
      this Bohemianism pleased me, but before very long it led to my losing the
      last shred of respect which I felt for her. What struck me as even more
      strange was the fact that, according as we had or had not guests, she was
      two different women. The one (the woman figuring in society) was a young
      and healthy, but rather cold, beauty, a person richly dressed, neither
      stupid nor clever, and unfailingly cheerful. The other woman (the one in
      evidence when no guests were present) was considerably past her first
      youth, languid, depressed, slovenly, and ennuyee, though affectionate.
      Frequently, as I looked at her when, smiling, rosy with the winter air,
      and happy in the consciousness of her beauty, she came in from a round of
      calls and, taking off her hat, went to look at herself in a mirror; or
      when, rustling in her rich, decollete ball dress, and at once shy and
      proud before the servants, she was passing to her carriage; or when, at
      one of our small receptions at home, she was sitting dressed in a high
      silken dress finished with some sort of fine lace about her soft neck, and
      flashing her unvarying, but lovely, smile around her&mdash;as I looked at
      her at such times I could not help wondering what would have been said by
      persons who had been ravished to behold her thus if they could have seen
      her as I often saw her, namely, when, waiting in the lonely midnight hours
      for her husband to return from his club, she would walk like a shadow from
      room to room, with her hair dishevelled and her form clad in a sort of
      dressing-jacket. Presently, she would sit down to the piano and, her brows
      all puckered with the effort, play over the only waltz that she knew;
      after which she would pick up a novel, read a few pages somewhere in the
      middle of it, and throw it aside. Next, repairing in person to the
      dining-room, so as not to disturb the servants, she would get herself a
      cucumber and some cold veal, and eat it standing by the window-sill&mdash;then
      once more resume her weary, aimless, gloomy wandering from room to room.
      But what, above all other things, caused estrangement between us was that
      lack of understanding which expressed itself chiefly in the peculiar air
      of indulgent attention with which she would listen when any one was
      speaking to her concerning matters of which she had no knowledge. It was
      not her fault that she acquired the unconscious habit of bending her head
      down and smiling slightly with her lips only when she found it necessary
      to converse on topics which did not interest her (which meant any topic
      except herself and her husband); yet that smile and that inclination of
      the head, when incessantly repeated, could become unbearably wearisome.
      Also, her peculiar gaiety&mdash;which always sounded as though she were
      laughing at herself, at you, and at the world in general&mdash;was gauche
      and anything but infectious, while her sympathy was too evidently forced.
      Lastly, she knew no reticence with regard to her ceaseless rapturising to
      all and sundry concerning her love for Papa. Although she only spoke the
      truth when she said that her whole life was bound up with him, and
      although she proved it her life long, we considered such unrestrained,
      continual insistence upon her affection for him bad form, and felt more
      ashamed for her when she was descanting thus before strangers even than we
      did when she was perpetrating bad blunders in French. Yet, although, as I
      have said, she loved her husband more than anything else in the world, and
      he too had a great affection for her (or at all events he had at first,
      and when he saw that others besides himself admired her beauty), it seemed
      almost as though she purposely did everything most likely to displease him&mdash;simply
      to prove to him the strength of her love, her readiness to sacrifice
      herself for his sake, and the fact that her one aim in life was to win his
      affection! She was fond of display, and my father too liked to see her as
      a beauty who excited wonder and admiration; yet she sacrificed her
      weakness for fine clothes to her love for him, and grew more and more
      accustomed to remain at home in a plain grey blouse. Again, Papa
      considered freedom and equality to be indispensable conditions of family
      life, and hoped that his favourite Lubotshka and his kind-hearted young
      wife would become sincere friends; yet once again Avdotia sacrificed
      herself by considering it incumbent upon her to pay the &ldquo;real mistress of
      the house,&rdquo; as she called Lubotshka, an amount of deference which only
      shocked and annoyed my father. Likewise, he played cards a great deal that
      winter, and lost considerable sums towards the end of it, wherefore,
      unwilling, as usual, to let his gambling affairs intrude upon his family
      life, he began to preserve complete secrecy concerning his play; yet
      Avdotia, though often ailing, as well as, towards the end of the winter,
      enceinte, considered herself bound always to sit up (in a grey blouse, and
      with her hair dishevelled) for my father when, at, say, four or five
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he returned home from the club ashamed, depleted
      in pocket, and weary. She would ask him absent-mindedly whether he had
      been fortunate in play, and listen with indulgent attention, little nods
      of her head, and a faint smile upon her face as he told her of his doings
      at the club and begged her, for about the hundredth time, never to sit up
      for him again. Yet, though Papa&rsquo;s winnings or losings (upon which his
      substance practically depended) in no way interested her, she was always
      the first to meet him when he returned home in the small hours of the
      morning. This she was incited to do, not only by the strength of her
      devotion, but by a certain secret jealousy from which she suffered. No one
      in the world could persuade her that it was REALLY from his club, and not
      from a mistress&rsquo;s, that Papa came home so late. She would try to read love
      secrets in his face, and, discerning none there, would sigh with a sort of
      enjoyment of her grief, and give herself up once more to the contemplation
      of her unhappiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the result of these and many other constant sacrifices which occurred
      in Papa&rsquo;s relations with his wife during the latter months of that winter
      (a time when he lost much, and was therefore out of spirits), there
      gradually grew up between the two an intermittent feeling of tacit
      hostility&mdash;of restrained aversion to the object of devotion of the
      kind which expresses itself in an unconscious eagerness to show the object
      in question every possible species of petty annoyance.

    <h2>
      XLIII. NEW COMRADES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The winter had passed imperceptibly and the thaw begun when the list of
      examinations was posted at the University, and I suddenly remembered that
      I had to return answers to questions in eighteen subjects on which I had
      heard lectures delivered, but with regard to some of which I had taken no
      notes and made no preparation whatever. It seems strange that the question
      &ldquo;How am I going to pass?&rdquo; should never have entered my head, but the truth
      is that all that winter I had been in such a state of haze through the
      delights of being both grown-up and &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo; that, whenever the
      question of the examinations had occurred to me, I had mentally compared
      myself with my comrades, and thought to myself, &ldquo;They are certain to pass,
      and as most of them are not &lsquo;comme il faut,&rsquo; and I am therefore their
      personal superior, I too am bound to come out all right.&rdquo; In fact, the
      only reason why I attended lectures at all was that I might become an
      habitue of the University, and obtain Papa&rsquo;s leave to go in and out of the
      house. Moreover, I had many acquaintances now, and often enjoyed myself
      vastly at the University. I loved the racket, talking, and laughter in the
      auditorium, the opportunities for sitting on a back bench, and letting the
      measured voice of the professor lure one into dreams as one contemplated
      one&rsquo;s comrades, the occasional runnings across the way for a snack and a
      glass of vodka (sweetened by the fearful joy of knowing that one might be
      hauled before the professor for so doing), the stealthy closing of the
      door as one returned to the auditorium, and the participation in &ldquo;course
      versus course&rdquo; scuffles in the corridors. All this was very enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time, however, that every one had begun to put in a better
      attendance at lectures, and the professor of physics had completed his
      course and taken his leave of us until the examinations came on, and the
      students were busy collecting their notebooks and arranging to do their
      preparation in parties, it struck me that I also had better prepare for
      the ordeal. Operoff, with whom I still continued on bowing, but otherwise
      most frigid, terms, suddenly offered not only to lend me his notebooks,
      but to let me do my preparation with himself and some other students. I
      thanked him, and accepted the invitation&mdash;hoping by that conferment
      of honour completely to dissipate our old misunderstanding; but at the
      same time I requested that the gatherings should always be held at my
      home, since my quarters were so splendid! To this the students replied
      that they meant to take turn and turn about&mdash;sometimes to meet at one
      fellow&rsquo;s place, sometimes at another&rsquo;s, as might be most convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of our reunions was held at Zuchin&rsquo;s, who had a small
      partition-room in a large building on the Trubni Boulevard. The opening
      night I arrived late, and entered when the reading aloud had already
      begun. The little apartment was thick with tobacco-smoke, while on the
      table stood a bottle of vodka, a decanter, some bread, some salt, and a
      shin-bone of mutton. Without rising, Zuchin asked me to have some vodka
      and to doff my tunic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect you are not accustomed to such entertainment,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one was wearing a dirty cotton shirt and a dickey. Endeavouring not
      to show my contempt for the company, I took off my tunic, and lay down in
      a sociable manner on the sofa. Zuchin went on reading aloud and correcting
      himself with the help of notebooks, while the others occasionally stopped
      him to ask a question, which he always answered with ability, correctness,
      and precision. I listened for a time with the rest, but, not understanding
      much of it, since I had not been present at what had been read before,
      soon interpolated a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, old fellow! It will be no good for you to listen if you do not
      know the subject,&rdquo; said Zuchin. &ldquo;I will lend you my notebooks, and then
      you can read it up by to-morrow, and I will explain it to you.&rdquo;

      I felt rather ashamed of my ignorance. Also, I felt the truth of what he
      said; so I gave up listening, and amused myself by observing my new
      comrades. According to my classification of humanity, into persons &ldquo;comme
      il faut&rdquo; and persons not &ldquo;comme il faut,&rdquo; they evidently belonged to the
      latter category, and so aroused in me not only a feeling of contempt, but
      also a certain sensation of personal hostility, for the reason that,
      though not &ldquo;comme il faut,&rdquo; they accounted me their equal, and actually
      patronised me in a sort of good-humoured fashion. What in particular
      excited in me this feeling was their feet, their dirty nails and fingers,
      a particularly long talon on Operoff&rsquo;s obtrusive little finger, their red
      shirts, their dickeys, the chaff which they good-naturedly threw at one
      another, the dirty room, a habit which Zuchin had of continually snuffling
      and pressing a finger to his nose, and, above all, their manner of
      speaking&mdash;that is to say, their use and intonation of words. For
      instance, they said &ldquo;flat&rdquo; for fool, &ldquo;just the ticket&rdquo; for exactly,
      &ldquo;grandly&rdquo; for splendidly, and so on&mdash;all of which seemed to me either
      bookish or disagreeably vulgar. Still more was my &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo;
       refinement disturbed by the accents which they put upon certain Russian&mdash;and,
      still more, upon foreign&mdash;words. Thus they said dieYATelnost for
      DIEyatelnost, NARochno for naROChno, v&rsquo;KAMinie for v&rsquo;kaMINie, SHAKespeare
      for ShakesPEARe, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, for all their insuperably repellent exterior, I could detect
      something good in these fellows, and envied them the cheerful
      good-fellowship which united them in one. Consequently, I began to feel
      attracted towards them, and made up my mind that, come what might, I would
      become of their number. The kind and honourable Operoff I knew already,
      and now the brusque, but exceptionally clever, Zuchin (who evidently took
      the lead in this circle) began to please me greatly. He was a dark,
      thick-set little fellow, with a perennially glistening, polished face, but
      one that was extremely lively, intellectual, and independent in its
      expression. That expression it derived from a low, but prominent,
      forehead, deep black eyes, short, bristly hair, and a thick, dark beard
      which looked as though it stood in constant need of trimming. Although,
      too, he seemed to think nothing of himself (a trail which always pleased
      me in people), it was clear that he never let his brain rest. He had one
      of those expressive faces which, a few hours after you have seen them for
      the first time, change suddenly and entirely to your view. Such a change
      took place, in my eyes, with regard to Zuchin&rsquo;s face towards the end of
      that evening. Suddenly, I seemed to see new wrinkles appear upon its
      surface, its eyes grow deeper, its smile become a different one, and the
      whole face assume such an altered aspect that I scarcely recognised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the reading was ended, Zuchin, the other students, and myself
      manifested our desire to be &ldquo;comrades all&rdquo; by drinking vodka until little
      remained in the bottle. Thereupon Zuchin asked if any one had a
      quarter-rouble to spare, so that he could send the old woman who looked
      after him to buy some more; yet, on my offering to provide the money, he
      made as though he had not heard me, and turned to Operoff, who pulled out
      a purse sewn with bugles, and handed him the sum required.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mind you don&rsquo;t get drunk,&rdquo; added the giver, who himself had not
      partaken of the vodka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heavens!&rdquo; answered Zuchin as he sucked the marrow out of a mutton bone
      (I remember thinking that it must be because he ate marrow that he was so
      clever). &ldquo;By heavens!&rdquo; he went on with a slight smile (and his smile was
      of the kind that one involuntarily noticed, and somehow felt grateful
      for), &ldquo;even if I did get drunk, there would be no great harm done. I
      wonder which of us two could look after himself the better&mdash;you or I?
      Anyway I am willing to make the experiment,&rdquo; and he slapped his forehead
      with mock boastfulness. &ldquo;But what a pity it is that Semenoff has
      disappeared! He has gone and completely hidden himself somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, the grey-haired Semenoff who had comforted me so much at my
      first examination by being worse dressed than myself, and who, after
      passing the second examination, had attended his lectures regularly during
      the first month, had disappeared thereafter from view, and never been seen
      at the University throughout the latter part of the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo; replied Zuchin. &ldquo;He has escaped my eye altogether. Yet
      what fun I used to have with him! What fire there was in the man! and what
      an intellect! I should be indeed sorry if he has come to grief&mdash;and
      come to grief he probably has, for he was no mere boy to take his
      University course in instalments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little further conversation, and agreeing to meet again the next
      night at Zuchin&rsquo;s, since his abode was the most central point for us all,
      we began to disperse. As, one by one, we left the room, my conscience
      started pricking me because every one seemed to be going home on foot,
      whereas I had my drozhki. Accordingly, with some hesitation I offered
      Operoff a lift. Zuchin came to the door with us, and, after borrowing a
      rouble of Operoff, went off to make a night of it with some friends. As we
      drove along, Operoff told me a good deal about Zuchin&rsquo;s character and mode
      of life, and on reaching home it was long before I could get to sleep for
      thinking of the new acquaintances I had made. For many an hour, as I lay
      awake, I kept wavering between the respect which their knowledge,
      simplicity, and sense of honour, as well as the poetry of their youth and
      courage, excited in my regard, and the distaste which I felt for their
      outward man. In spite of my desire to do so, it was at that time literally
      impossible for me to associate with them, since our ideas were too wholly
      at variance. For me, life&rsquo;s meaning and charm contained an infinitude of
      shades of which they had not an inkling, and vice versa. The greatest
      obstacles of all, however, to our better acquaintance I felt to be the
      twenty roubles&rsquo; worth of cloth in my tunic, my drozhki, and my white linen
      shirt; and they appeared to me most important obstacles, since they made
      me feel as though I had unwittingly insulted these comrades by displaying
      such tokens of my wealth. I felt guilty in their eyes, and as though,
      whether I accepted or rejected their acquittal and took a line of my own,
      I could never enter into equal and unaffected relations with them. Yet to
      such an extent did the stirring poetry of the courage which I could detect
      in Zuchin (in particular) overshadow the coarse, vicious side of his
      nature that the latter made no unpleasant impression upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a couple of weeks I visited Zuchin&rsquo;s almost every night for purposes
      of work. Yet I did very little there, since, as I have said, I had lost
      ground at the start, and, not having sufficient grit in me to catch up my
      companions by solitary study, was forced merely to PRETEND that I was
      listening to and taking in all they were reading. I have an idea, too,
      that they divined my pretence, since I often noticed that they passed over
      points which they themselves knew without first inquiring of me whether I
      did the same. Yet, day by day, I was coming to regard the vulgarity of
      this circle with more indulgence, to feel increasingly drawn towards its
      way of life, and to find in it much that was poetical. Only my word of
      honour to Dimitri that I would never indulge in dissipation with these new
      comrades kept me from deciding also to share their diversions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, I thought I would make a display of my knowledge of literature,
      particularly French literature, and so led the conversation to that theme.
      Judge, then, of my surprise when I discovered that not only had my
      companions been reading the foreign passages in Russian, but that they had
      studied far more foreign works than I had, and knew and could appraise
      English, and even Spanish, writers of whom I had never so much as heard!
      Likewise, Pushkin and Zhukovski represented to them LITERATURE, and not,
      as to myself, certain books in yellow covers which I had once read and
      studied when a child. For Dumas and Sue they had an almost equal contempt,
      and, in general, were competent to form much better and clearer judgments
      on literary matters than I was, for all that I refused to recognise the
      fact. In knowledge of music, too, I could not beat them, and was
      astonished to find that Operoff played the violin, and another student the
      cello and piano, while both of them were members of the University
      orchestra, and possessed a wide knowledge of and appreciation of good
      music. In short, with the exception of the French and German languages, my
      companions were better posted at every point than I was, yet not the least
      proud of the fact. True, I might have plumed myself on my position as a
      man of the world, but Woloda excelled me even in that. Wherein, then, lay
      the height from which I presumed to look down upon these comrades? In my
      acquaintanceship with Prince Ivan Ivanovitch? In my ability to speak
      French? In my drozhki? In my linen shirt? In my finger-nails? &ldquo;Surely
      these things are all rubbish,&rdquo; was the thought which would come flitting
      through my head under the influence of the envy which the good-fellowship
      and kindly, youthful gaiety displayed around me excited in my breast.
      Every one addressed his interlocutor in the second person singular. True,
      the familiarity of this address almost approximated to rudeness, yet even
      the boorish exterior of the speaker could not conceal a constant endeavour
      never to hurt another one&rsquo;s feelings. The terms &ldquo;brute&rdquo; or &ldquo;swine,&rdquo; when
      used in this good-natured fashion, only convulsed me, and gave me cause
      for inward merriment. In no way did they offend the person addressed, or
      prevent the company at large from remaining on the most sincere and
      friendly footing. In all their intercourse these youths were delicate and
      forbearing in a way that only very poor and very young men can be. However
      much I might detect in Zuchin&rsquo;s character and amusements an element of
      coarseness and profligacy, I could also detect the fact that his
      drinking-bouts were of a very different order to the puerility with burnt
      rum and champagne in which I had participated at Baron Z.&lsquo;s.

    <h2>
      XLIV. ZUCHIN AND SEMENOFF
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although I do not know what class of society Zuchin belonged to, I know
      that, without the help either of means or social position, he had
      matriculated from the Seventh Gymnasium. At that time he was eighteen&mdash;though
      he looked much older&mdash;and very clever, especially in his powers of
      assimilation. To him it was easier to survey the whole of some complicated
      subject, to foresee its various parts and deductions, than to use that
      knowledge, when gained, for reasoning out the exact laws to which those
      deductions were due. He knew that he was clever, and of the fact he was
      proud; yet from that very pride arose the circumstance that he treated
      every one with unvarying simplicity and good-nature. Moreover, his
      experience of life must have been considerable, for already he had
      squandered much love, friendship, activity, and money. Though poor and
      moving only in the lower ranks of society, there was nothing which he had
      ever attempted for which he did not thenceforth feel the contempt, the
      indifference, or the utter disregard which were bound to result from his
      attaining his goal too easily. In fact, the very ardour with which he
      applied himself to a new pursuit seemed to be due to his contempt for what
      he had already attained, since his abilities always led him to success,
      and therefore to a certain right to despise it. With the sciences it was
      the same. Though little interested in them, and taking no notes, he knew
      mathematics thoroughly, and was uttering no vain boast when he said that
      he could beat the professor himself. Much of what he heard said in
      lectures he thought rubbish, yet with his peculiar habit of unconsciously
      practical roguishness he feigned to subscribe to all that the professors
      thought important, and every professor adored him. True, he was outspoken
      to the authorities, but they none the less respected him. Besides
      disliking and despising the sciences, he despised all who laboured to
      attain what he himself had mastered so easily, since the sciences, as he
      understood them, did not occupy one-tenth part of his powers. In fact,
      life, as he saw it from the student&rsquo;s standpoint, contained nothing to
      which he could devote himself wholly, and his impetuous, active nature (as
      he himself often said) demanded life complete: wherefore he frequented the
      drinking-bout in so far as he could afford it, and surrendered himself to
      dissipation chiefly out of a desire to get as far away from himself as
      possible. Consequently, just as the examinations were approaching,
      Operoff&rsquo;s prophecy to me came true, for Zuchin wasted two whole weeks in
      this fashion, and we had to do the latter part of our preparation at
      another student&rsquo;s. Yet at the first examination he reappeared with pale,
      haggard face and tremulous hands, and passed brilliantly into the second
      course!
    </p>
    <p>
      The company of roisterers of which Zuchin had been the leader since its
      formation at the beginning of the term consisted of eight students, among
      whom, at first, had been numbered Ikonin and Semenoff; but the former had
      left under the strain of the continuous revelry in which the band had
      indulged in the early part of the term, and the latter seceded later for
      reasons which were never wholly explained. In its early days this band had
      been looked upon with awe by all the fellows of our course, and had had
      its exploits much discussed. Of these exploits the leading heroes had been
      Zuchin and, towards the end of the term, Semenoff, but the latter had come
      to be generally shunned, and to cause disturbances on the rare occasions
      when he attended a lecture. Just before the examinations began, he rounded
      off his drinking exploits in a most energetic and original fashion, as I
      myself had occasion to witness (through my acquaintanceship with Zuchin).
      This is how it was. One evening we had just assembled at Zuchin&rsquo;s, and
      Operoff, reinforcing a candlestick with a candle stuck in a bottle, had
      just plunged his nose into his notebooks and begun to read aloud in his
      thin voice from his neatly-written notes on physics, when the landlady
      entered the room, and informed Zuchin that some one had brought a note for
      him... [The remainder of this chapter is omitted in the original.]

    <h2>
      XLV. I COME TO GRIEF
    </h2>
    <p>
      At length the first examination&mdash;on differentials and integrals&mdash;drew
      near, but I continued in a vague state which precluded me from forming any
      clear idea of what was awaiting me. Every evening, after consorting with
      Zuchin and the rest, the thought would occur to me that there was
      something in my convictions which I must change&mdash;something wrong and
      mistaken; yet every morning the daylight would find me again satisfied to
      be &ldquo;comme il faut,&rdquo; and desirous of no change whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the frame of mind in which I attended for the first examination.
      I seated myself on the bench where the princes, counts, and barons always
      sat, and began talking to them in French, with the not unnatural result
      that I never gave another thought to the answers which I was shortly to
      return to questions in a subject of which I knew nothing. I gazed supinely
      at other students as they went up to be examined, and even allowed myself
      to chaff some of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Grap,&rdquo; I said to Ilinka (who, from our first entry into the
      University, had shaken off my influence, had ceased to smile when I spoke
      to him, and always remained ill-disposed towards me), &ldquo;have you survived
      the ordeal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; retorted Ilinka. &ldquo;Let us see if YOU can do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled contemptuously at the answer, notwithstanding that the doubt
      which he had expressed had given me a momentary shock. Once again,
      however, indifference overlaid that feeling, and I remained so entirely
      absent-minded and supine that, the very moment after I had been examined
      (a mere formality for me, as it turned out) I was making a dinner
      appointment with Baron Z. When called out with Ikonin, I smoothed the
      creases in my uniform, and walked up to the examiner&rsquo;s table with perfect
      sang froid.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, a slight shiver of apprehension ran down my back when the young
      professor&mdash;the same one as had examined me for my matriculation&mdash;looked
      me straight in the face as I reached across to the envelope containing the
      tickets. Ikonin, though taking a ticket with the same plunge of his whole
      body as he had done at the previous examinations, did at least return some
      sort of an answer this time, though a poor one. I, on the contrary, did
      just as he had done on the two previous occasions, or even worse, since I
      took a second ticket, yet for a second time returned no answer. The
      professor looked me compassionately in the face, and said in a quiet, but
      determined, voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not pass into the second course, Monsieur Irtenieff. You had
      better not complete the examinations. The faculty must be weeded out. The
      same with you, Monsieur Ikonin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ikonin implored leave to finish the examinations, as a great favour, but
      the professor replied that he (Ikonin) was not likely to do in two days
      what he had not succeeded in doing in a year, and that he had not the
      smallest chance of passing. Ikonin renewed his humble, piteous appeals,
      but the professor was inexorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go, gentlemen,&rdquo; he remarked in the same quiet, resolute voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was only too glad to do so, for I felt ashamed of seeming, by my silent
      presence, to be joining in Ikonin&rsquo;s humiliating prayers for grace. I have
      no recollection of how I threaded my way through the students in the hall,
      nor of what I replied to their questions, nor of how I passed into the
      vestibule and departed home. I was offended, humiliated, and genuinely
      unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days I never left my room, and saw no one, but found relief in
      copious tears. I should have sought a pistol to shoot myself if I had had
      the necessary determination for the deed. I thought that Ilinka Grap would
      spit in my face when he next met me, and that he would have the right to
      do so; that Operoff would rejoice at my misfortune, and tell every one of
      it; that Kolpikoff had justly shamed me that night at the restaurant; that
      my stupid speeches to Princess Kornikoff had had their fitting result; and
      so on, and so on. All the moments in my life which had been for me most
      difficult and painful recurred to my mind. I tried to blame some one for
      my calamity, and thought that some one must have done it on purpose&mdash;must
      have conspired a whole intrigue against me. Next, I murmured against the
      professors, against my comrades, Woloda, Dimitri, and Papa (the last for
      having sent me to the University at all). Finally, I railed at Providence
      for ever having let me see such ignominy. Believing myself ruined for ever
      in the eyes of all who knew me, I besought Papa to let me go into the
      hussars or to the Caucasus. Naturally, Papa was anything but pleased at
      what had happened; yet, on seeing my passionate grief, he comforted me by
      saying that, though it was a bad business, it might yet be mended by my
      transferring to another faculty. Woloda, who also saw nothing very
      terrible in my misfortune, added that at least I should not be put out of
      countenance in a new faculty, since I should have new comrades there. As
      for the ladies of the household, they neither knew nor cared what either
      an examination or a plucking meant, and condoled with me only because they
      saw me in such distress. Dimitri came to see me every day, and was very
      kind and consolatory throughout; but for that very reason he seemed to me
      to have grown colder than before. It always hurt me and made me feel
      uncomfortable when he came up to my room and seated himself in silence
      beside me, much as a doctor might scat himself by the bedside of an
      awkward patient. Sophia Ivanovna and Varenika sent me books for which I
      had expressed a wish, as also an invitation to go and see them, but in
      that very thoughtfulness of theirs I saw only proud, humiliating
      condescension to one who had fallen beyond forgiveness. Although, in three
      days&rsquo; time, I grew calmer, it was not until we departed for the country
      that I left the house, but spent the time in nursing my grief and
      wandering, fearful of all the household, through the various rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, as I was sitting deep in thought and listening to Avdotia
      playing her waltz, I suddenly leapt to my feet, ran upstairs, got out the
      copy-book whereon I had once inscribed &ldquo;Rules of My Life,&rdquo; opened it, and
      experienced my first moment of repentance and moral resolution. True, I
      burst into tears once more, but they were no longer tears of despair.
      Pulling myself together, I set about writing out a fresh set of rules, in
      the assured conviction that never again would I do a wrong action, waste a
      single moment on frivolity, or alter the rules which I now decided to
      frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long that moral impulse lasted, what it consisted of, and what new
      principles I devised for my moral growth I will relate when speaking of
      the ensuing and happier portion of my early manhood.

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
